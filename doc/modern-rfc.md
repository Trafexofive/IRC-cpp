This document intends to be a useful overview and reference of the IRC client protocol as it is implemented today. It is a [living specification](/about#living-specifications) which is updated in response to feedback and implementations as they change. This document describes existing behaviour and what I consider best practices for new software.

This **is not a new protocol** – it is the standard IRC protocol, just described in a single document with some already widely-implemented/accepted features and capabilities. Clients written to this spec will work with old and new servers, and servers written this way will service old and new clients.

TL;DR if a new RFC was released today describing how IRC works, this is what I think it would look like.

If something written in here isn't correct for or interoperable with an IRC server / network you know of, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ircdocs/modern-irc/issues) or [contact me](mailto:daniel@danieloaks.net).

NOTE: This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. All major points of the protocol are covered, but some common message and mode types are missing.

# Introduction

The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol has been designed over a number of years, with multitudes of implementations and use cases appearing. This document describes the IRC Client-Server protocol.

IRC is a text-based chat protocol which has proven itself valuable and useful. It is well-suited to running on many machines in a distributed fashion. A typical setup involves multiple servers connected in a distributed network. Messages are delivered through this network and state is maintained across it for the connected clients and active channels.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# <a href="#irc-concepts" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IRC Concepts

This section describes concepts behind the implementation and organisation of the IRC protocol, which are useful in understanding how it works.

## <a href="#architectural" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Architectural

A typical IRC network consists of servers and clients connected to those servers, with a good mix of IRC operators and channels. This section goes through each of those, what they are and a brief overview of them.

### <a href="#servers" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Servers

Servers form the backbone of IRC, providing a point to which clients may connect and talk to each other, and a point for other servers to connect to, forming an IRC network.

The most common network configuration for IRC servers is that of a spanning tree \[see the figure below\], where each server acts as a central node for the rest of the network it sees. Other topologies are being experimented with, but right now there are none widely used in production.

Format of a typical IRC network.

There have been several terms created over time to describe the roles of different servers on an IRC network. Some of the most common terms are as follows:

-   **Hub**: A ‘hub’ is a server that connects to multiple other servers. For instance, in the figure above, Server 2, Server 3, and Server 4 would be examples of hub servers.
-   **Core Hub**: A ‘core hub’ is typically a hub server that connects fairly major parts of the IRC network together. What is considered a core hub will change depending on the size of a network and what the administrators of the network consider important. For instance, in the figure above, Server 1, Server 2, and Server 3 may be considered core hubs by the network administrators.
-   **Leaf**: A ‘leaf’ is a server that is only connected to a single other server on the network. Typically, leafs are the primary servers that handle client connections. In the figure above, Servers 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, and others would be considered leaf servers.
-   **Services**: A ‘services’ server is a special type of server that extends the capabilities of the server software on the network (ie, they provide *services* to the network). Services are not used on all networks, and the capabilities typically provided by them may be built-into server software itself rather than being provided by a separate software package. Features usually handled by services include client account registration (as are typically used for [SASL authentication](#authenticate-message)), channel registration (allowing client accounts to ‘own’ channels), and further modifications and extensions to the IRC protocol. ‘Services’ themselves are **not** specified in any way by the protocol, they are different from the [services](#services) defined by the RFCs. What they provide depends entirely on the software packages being run.

A trend these days is to hide the real structure of a network from regular users. Networks that implement this may restrict or modify commands like [`MAP`](#map-message) so that regular users see every other server on the network as linked directly to the current server. When this is done, servers that do not handle client connections may also be hidden from users (hubs hidden in this way can be called ‘hidden hubs’). Generally, IRC operators can always see the true structure of a network.

These terms are not generally used in IRC protocol documentation, but may be used by the administrators of a network in order to differentiate the servers they run and their roles.

Servers SHOULD pick a name which contains a dot character `(".", 0x2E)`. This can help clients disambiguate between server names and nicknames in a message source.

### <a href="#clients" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clients

A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another server. Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique nickname. In addition to the nickname, all servers must have the following information about all clients: the real name/address of the host that the client is connecting from, the username of the client on that host, and the server to which the client is connected.

Nicknames are non-empty strings with the following restrictions:

-   They MUST NOT contain any of the following characters: space `(' ', 0x20)`, comma `(',', 0x2C)`, asterisk `('*', 0x2A)`, question mark `('?', 0x3F)`, exclamation mark `('!', 0x21)`, at sign `('@', 0x40)`.
-   They MUST NOT start with any of the following characters: dollar `('$', 0x24)`, colon `(':', 0x3A)`.
-   They MUST NOT start with a character listed as a [channel type](#channel-types), [channel membership prefix](#channel-membership-prefixes), or prefix listed in the IRCv3 [`multi-prefix` Extension](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multi-prefix).
-   They SHOULD NOT contain any dot character `('.', 0x2E)`.

Servers MAY have additional implementation-specific nickname restrictions and SHOULD avoid the use of nicknames which are ambiguous with commands or command parameters where this could lead to confusion or error.

### <a href="#services" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Services

Services were a different kind of clients than users, defined in the [RFC2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812.html#section-1.2.2). They were to provide or collect information about the IRC network. They are no longer used now. As such the service-related messages (`SERVICE`, `SERVLIST` and `SQUERY`) are also deprecated.

#### <a href="#operators" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operators

To allow a reasonable amount of order to be kept within the IRC network, a special class of clients (operators) are allowed to perform general maintenance functions on the network. Although the powers granted to an operator can be considered as ‘dangerous’, they are nonetheless required.

The tasks operators can perform vary with different server software and the specific privileges granted to each operator. Some can perform network maintenance tasks, such as disconnecting and reconnecting servers as needed to prevent long-term use of bad network routing. Some operators can also remove a user from their server or the IRC network by ‘force’, i.e. the operator is able to close the connection between a client and server.

The justification for operators being able to remove users from the network is delicate since its abuse is both destructive and annoying. However, IRC network policies and administrators handle operators who abuse their privileges, and what is considered abuse by that network.

### <a href="#channels" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channels

A channel is a named group of one or more clients. All clients in the channel will receive all messages addressed to that channel. The channel is created implicitly when the first client joins it, and the channel ceases to exist when the last client leaves it. While the channel exists, any client can reference the channel using the name of the channel. Networks that support the concept of ‘channel ownership’ may persist specific channels in some way while no clients are connected to them.

Channel names are strings (beginning with specified prefix characters). Apart from the requirement of the first character being a valid [channel type](#channel-types) prefix character; the only restriction on a channel name is that it may not contain any spaces `(' ', 0x20)`, a control G / `BELL` `('^G', 0x07)`, or a comma `(',', 0x2C)` (which is used as a list item separator by the protocol).

There are several types of channels used in the IRC protocol. The first standard type of channel is a [regular channel](#regular-channels-), which is known to all servers that are connected to the network. The prefix character for this type of channel is `('#', 0x23)`. The second type are server-specific or [local channels](#local-channels-), where the clients connected can only see and talk to other clients on the same server. The prefix character for this type of channel is `('&', 0x26)`. Other types of channels are described in the [Channel Types](#channel-types) section.

Along with various channel types, there are also channel modes that can alter the characteristics and behaviour of individual channels. See the [Channel Modes](#channel-modes) section for more information on these.

To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user is required to join the channel using the [`JOIN`](#join-message) command. If the channel doesn’t exist prior to joining, the channel is created and the creating user becomes a channel operator. If the channel already exists, whether or not the client successfully joins that channel depends on the modes currently set on the channel. For example, if the channel is set to `invite-only` mode (`+i`), the client only joins the channel if they have been invited by another user or they have been exempted from requiring an invite by the channel operators.

Channels also contain a [topic](#topic-message). The topic is a line shown to all users when they join the channel, and all users in the channel are notified when the topic of a channel is changed. Channel topics commonly state channel rules, links, quotes from channel members, a general description of the channel, or whatever the [channel operators](#channel-operators) want to share with the clients in their channel.

A user may be joined to several channels at once, but a limit may be imposed by the server as to how many channels a client can be in at one time. This limit is specified by the [`CHANLIMIT`](#chanlimit-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter. See the [Feature Advertisement](#feature-advertisement) section for more details on `RPL_ISUPPORT`.

If the IRC network becomes disjoint because of a split between servers, the channel on either side is composed of only those clients which are connected to servers on the respective sides of the split, possibly ceasing to exist on one side. When the split is healed, the connecting servers ensure the network state is consistent between them.

#### <a href="#channel-operators" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel Operators

Channel operators (or “chanops”) on a given channel are considered to ‘run’ or ‘own’ that channel. In recognition of this status, channel operators are endowed with certain powers which let them moderate and keep control of their channel.

Most IRC operators do not concern themselves with ‘channel politics’. In addition, a large number of networks leave the management of specific channels up to chanops where possible, and try not to interfere themselves. However, this is a matter of network policy, and it’s best to consult the [Message of the Day](#motd-message) when looking at channel management.

IRC servers may also define other levels of channel moderation. These can include ‘halfop’ (half operator), ‘protected’ (protected user/operator), ‘founder’ (channel founder), and any other positions the server wishes to define. These moderation levels have varying privileges and can execute, and not execute, various channel management commands based on what the server defines.

The commands which may only be used by channel moderators include:

-   [`KICK`](#kick-message): Eject a client from the channel
-   [`MODE`](#mode-message): Change the channel’s modes
-   [`INVITE`](#invite-message): Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
-   [`TOPIC`](#topic-message): Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

Channel moderators are identified by the channel member prefix (`'@'` for standard channel operators, `'%'` for halfops) next to their nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (e.g. replies to the [`NAMES`](#names-message), [`WHO`](#who-message), and [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) commands).

Specific prefixes and moderation levels are covered in the [Channel Membership Prefixes](#channel-membership-prefixes) section.

## <a href="#communication-types" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Communication Types

*This section describes how current implementations deliver different classes of messages and is not normative.*

This section ONLY deals with the spanning-tree topology, shown in the figure below. This is because spanning-tree is the topology specified and used in all IRC software today. Other topologies are being experimented with, but are not yet used in production by networks.

                              1--\
                                  A        D---4
                              2--/ \      /
                                    B----C
                                   /      \
                                  3        E

       Servers: A, B, C, D, E         Clients: 1, 2, 3, 4

Sample small IRC network.

### <a href="#one-to-one-communication" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One-to-one communication

Communication on a one-to-one basis is usually only performed by clients, since most server-server traffic is not a result of servers talking only to each other.

Servers should be able to send a message from any one client to any other. Servers send a message in exactly one direction along the spanning tree to reach any client. Thus the path of a message being delivered is the shortest path between any two points on the spanning tree.

The following examples all refer to the figure above.

1.  A message between clients 1 and 2 is only seen by server A, which sends it straight to client 2.

2.  A message between clients 1 and 3 is seen by servers A, B, and client 3. No other clients or servers are allowed to see the message.

3.  A message between clients 2 and 4 is seen by servers A, B, C, D, and client 4 only.

### <a href="#one-to-many-communication" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One-to-many communication

The main goal of IRC is to provide a forum which allows easy and efficient conferencing (one to many conversations). IRC offers several means to achieve this, each serving its own purpose.

#### <a href="#to-a-channel" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To A Channel

In IRC, the channel has a role equivalent to that of the multicast group; their existence is dynamic and the actual conversation carried out on a channel is generally sent only to servers which are supporting users on a given channel, and only once to every local link as each server is responsible for fanning the original message to ensure it will reach all recipients.

The following examples all refer to the above figure:

1.  Any channel with a single client in it. Messages to this channel go to the server and then nowhere else.

2.  Two clients in a channel. All messages traverse a path as if they were private messages between the two clients outside a channel.

3.  Clients 1, 2, and 3 are in a channel. All messages to this channel are sent to all clients and only those servers which must be traversed by the message if it were a private message to a single client. If client 1 sends a message, it goes back to client 2 and then via server B to client 3.

#### <a href="#to-a-hostserver-mask" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To A Host/Server Mask

To provide with some mechanism to send messages to a large body of related users, host and server mask messages are available. These messages are sent to users whose host or server information match that of the given mask. The messages are only sent to locations where the users are, in a fashion similar to that of channels.

#### <a href="#to-a-list" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To A List

The least efficient style of one-to-many conversation is through clients talking to a ‘list’ of targets (client, channel, ask). How this is done is almost self-explanatory: the client gives a list of destinations to which the message is to be delivered and the server breaks it up and dispatches a separate copy of the message to each given destination.

This is not as efficient as using a channel since the destination list may be broken up and the dispatch sent without checking to make sure duplicates aren’t sent down each path.

### <a href="#one-to-all" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One-To-All

The one-to-all type of message is better described as a broadcast message, sent to all clients or servers or both. On a large network of users and servers, a single message can result in a lot of traffic being sent over the network in an effort to reach all of the desired destinations.

For some class of messages, there is no option but to broadcast it to all servers to that the state information held by each server is consistent between them.

#### <a href="#client-to-client" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client-to-Client

IRC Operators may be able to send a message to every client currently connected to the network. This depends on the specific features and commands implemented in the server software.

#### <a href="#client-to-server" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client-to-Server

Most of the commands which result in a change of state information (such as channel membership, channel modes, user status, etc.) MUST be sent to all servers by default, and this distribution SHALL NOT be changed by the client.

#### <a href="#server-to-server" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Server-to-Server

While most messages between servers are distributed to all ‘other’ servers, this is only required for any message that affects a user, channel, or server. Since these are the basic items found in IRC, nearly all messages originating from a server are broadcast to all other connected servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#connection-setup" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connection Setup

IRC client-server connections work over TCP/IP. The standard ports for client-server connections are TCP/6667 for plaintext, and TCP/6697 for TLS connections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#server-to-server-protocol-structure" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Server-to-Server Protocol Structure

Both [RFC1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html) and [RFC2813](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2813.html) define a Server-to-Server protocol. But in the decades since, implementations have extended this protocol and diverged (see [TS6](https://github.com/grawity/irc-docs/blob/725a1f05b85d7a935986ae4f49b058e9b67e7ce9/server/ts6.txt) and [P10](http://web.mit.edu/klmitch/Sipb/devel/src/ircu2.10.11/doc/p10.html)), and servers have created entirely new protocols (see [InspIRCd](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd)). The days where there was one Server-to-Server Protocol that everyone uses hasn’t existed for a long time now.

However, different IRC implementations don’t *need* to interact with each other. Networks generally run one server software across their entire network, and use the S2S protocol implemented by that server. The client protocol is important, but how servers on the network talk to each other is considered an implementation detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#client-to-server-protocol-structure" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client-to-Server Protocol Structure

While a client is connected to a server, they send a stream of bytes to each other. This stream contains messages separated by `CR` `('\r', 0x0D)` and `LF` `('\n', 0x0A)`. These messages may be sent at any time from either side, and may generate zero or more reply messages.

Software SHOULD use the [UTF-8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629) character encoding to encode and decode messages, with fallbacks as described in the [Character Encodings](#character-encodings) implementation considerations appendix.

Names of IRC entities (clients, servers, channels) are casemapped. This prevents, for example, someone having the nickname `'Dan'` and someone else having the nickname `'dan'`, confusing other users. Servers MUST advertise the casemapping they use in the [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#feature-advertisement) numeric that’s sent when connection registration has completed.

## <a href="#message-format" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Message Format

An IRC message is a single line, delimited by a pair of `CR` `('\r', 0x0D)` and `LF` `('\n', 0x0A)` characters.

-   When reading messages from a stream, read the incoming data into a buffer. Only parse and process a message once you encounter the `\r\n` at the end of it. If you encounter an empty message, silently ignore it.
-   When sending messages, ensure that a pair of `\r\n` characters follows every single message your software sends out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Messages have this format, as rough ABNF:

      message         ::= ['@' <tags> SPACE] [':' <source> SPACE] <command> <parameters> <crlf>
      SPACE           ::=  %x20 *( %x20 )   ; space character(s)
      crlf            ::=  %x0D %x0A        ; "carriage return" "linefeed"

The specific parts of an IRC message are:

-   **tags**: Optional metadata on a message, starting with `('@', 0x40)`.
-   **source**: Optional note of where the message came from, starting with `(':', 0x3A)`.
-   **command**: The specific command this message represents.
-   **parameters**: If it exists, data relevant to this specific command.

These message parts, and parameters themselves, are separated by one or more ASCII SPACE characters `(' ', 0x20)`.

Most IRC servers limit messages to 512 bytes in length, including the trailing `CR-LF` characters. Implementations which include [message tags](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-tags.html) need to allow additional bytes for the **tags** section of a message; clients must allow 8191 additional bytes and servers must allow 4096 additional bytes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe how to process each part, but here are a few complete example messages:

      :irc.example.com CAP LS * :multi-prefix extended-join sasl

      @id=234AB :dan!d@localhost PRIVMSG #chan :Hey what's up!

      CAP REQ :sasl

### <a href="#tags" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tags

This is the format of the **tags** part:

      <tags>          ::= <tag> [';' <tag>]*
      <tag>           ::= <key> ['=' <escaped value>]
      <key>           ::= [ <client_prefix> ] [ <vendor> '/' ] <sequence of letters, digits, hyphens (`-`)>
      <client_prefix> ::= '+'
      <escaped value> ::= <sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, semicolon (`;`) and SPACE>
      <vendor>        ::= <host>

Basically, a series of `<key>[=<value>]` segments, separated by `(';', 0x3B)`.

The **tags** part is optional, and MUST NOT be sent unless explicitly enabled by [a capability](#capability-negotiation). This message part starts with a leading `('@', 0x40)` character, which MUST be the first character of the message itself. The leading `('@', 0x40)` is stripped from the value before it gets processed further.

Here are some examples of tags sections and how they could be represented as [JSON](https://www.json.org/) objects:

      @id=123AB;rose         ->  {"id": "123AB", "rose": ""}

      @url=;netsplit=tur,ty  ->  {"url": "", "netsplit": "tur,ty"}

For more information on processing tags – including the naming and registration of them, and how to escape values – see the IRCv3 [Message Tags specification](http://ircv3.net/specs/core/message-tags-3.2.html).

### <a href="#source" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Source

      source          ::=  <servername> / ( <nickname> [ "!" <user> ] [ "@" <host> ] )
      nick            ::=  <any characters except NUL, CR, LF, chantype character, and SPACE> <possibly empty sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, and SPACE>
      user            ::=  <sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, and SPACE>

The **source** (formerly known as **prefix**) is optional and starts with a `(':', 0x3A)` character (which is stripped from the value), and if there are no tags it MUST be the first character of the message itself.

The source indicates the true origin of a message. If the source is missing from a message, it’s is assumed to have originated from the client/server on the other end of the connection the message was received on.

Clients MUST NOT include a source when sending a message.

Servers MAY include a source on any message, and MAY leave a source off of any message. Clients MUST be able to process any given message the same way whether it contains a source or does not contain one.

### <a href="#command" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Command

      command         ::=  letter* / 3digit

The **command** must either be a valid IRC command or a numeric (a three-digit number represented as text).

Information on specific commands / numerics can be found in the [Client Messages](#client-messages) and [Numerics](#numerics) sections, respectively.

### <a href="#parameters" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parameters

This is the format of the **parameters** part:

      parameters      ::=  *( SPACE middle ) [ SPACE ":" trailing ]
      nospcrlfcl      ::=  <sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, colon (`:`) and SPACE>
      middle          ::=  nospcrlfcl *( ":" / nospcrlfcl )
      trailing        ::=  *( ":" / " " / nospcrlfcl )

**Parameters** (or ‘params’) are extra pieces of information added to the end of a message. These parameters generally make up the ‘data’ portion of the message. What specific parameters mean changes for every single message.

Parameters are a series of values separated by one or more ASCII SPACE characters `(' ', 0x20)`. However, this syntax is insufficient in two cases: a parameter that contains one or more spaces, and an empty parameter. To permit such parameters, the final parameter can be prepended with a `(':', 0x3A)` character, in which case that character is stripped and the rest of the message is treated as the final parameter, including any spaces it contains. Parameters that contain spaces, are empty, or begin with a `':'` character MUST be sent with a preceding `':'`; in other cases the use of a preceding `':'` on the final parameter is OPTIONAL.

Software SHOULD AVOID sending more than 15 parameters, as older client protocol documents specified this was the maximum and some clients may have trouble reading more than this. However, clients MUST parse incoming messages with any number of them.

Here are some examples of messages and how the parameters would be represented as [JSON](https://www.json.org/) lists:

      :irc.example.com CAP * LIST :         ->  ["*", "LIST", ""]

      CAP * LS :multi-prefix sasl           ->  ["*", "LS", "multi-prefix sasl"]

      CAP REQ :sasl message-tags foo        ->  ["REQ", "sasl message-tags foo"]

      :dan!d@localhost PRIVMSG #chan :Hey!  ->  ["#chan", "Hey!"]

      :dan!d@localhost PRIVMSG #chan Hey!   ->  ["#chan", "Hey!"]

      :dan!d@localhost PRIVMSG #chan ::-)   ->  ["#chan", ":-)"]

As these examples show, a trailing parameter (a final parameter with a preceding `':'`) has the same semantics as any other parameter, and MUST NOT be treated specially or stored separately once the `':'` is stripped.

### <a href="#compatibility-with-incorrect-software" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility with incorrect software

Servers SHOULD handle single `\n` character, and MAY handle a single `\r` character, as if it was a `\r\n` pair, to support existing clients that might send this. However, clients and servers alike MUST NOT send single `\r` or `\n` characters.

Servers and clients SHOULD ignore empty lines.

Servers SHOULD gracefully handle messages over the 512-bytes limit. They may:

-   Send an error numeric back, preferably [`ERR_INPUTTOOLONG`](#errinputtoolong-417) `(417)`
-   Truncate on the 510th byte (and add `\r\n` at the end) or, preferably, on the last UTF-8 character or grapheme that fits.
-   Ignore the message or close the connection – but this may be confusing to users of buggy clients.

Finally, clients and servers SHOULD NOT use more than one space (`\x20`) character as `SPACE` as defined in the grammar above.

## <a href="#numeric-replies" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Numeric Replies

Most messages sent from a client to a server generates a reply of some sort. The most common form of reply is the numeric reply, used for both errors and normal replies. Distinct from a normal message, a numeric reply MUST contain a `<source>` and use a three-digit numeric as the command. A numeric reply SHOULD contain the target of the reply as the first parameter of the message. A numeric reply is not allowed to originate from a client.

In all other respects, a numeric reply is just like a normal message. A list of numeric replies is supplied in the [Numerics](#numerics) section.

## <a href="#wildcard-expressions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wildcard Expressions

When wildcards are allowed in a string, it is referred to as a “mask”.

For string matching purposes, the protocol allows the use of two special characters: `('?', 0x3F)` to match one and only one character, and `('*', 0x2A)` to match any number of any characters. These two characters can be escaped using the `('\', 0x5C)` character.

The ABNF syntax for this is:

      mask        =  *( nowild / noesc wildone / noesc wildmany )
      wildone     =  %x3F
      wildmany    =  %x2A
      nowild      =  %x01-29 / %x2B-3E / %x40-FF
                       ; any octet except NUL, "*", "?"
      noesc       =  %x01-5B / %x5D-FF
                       ; any octet except NUL and "\"

      matchone    =  %x01-FF
                       ; matches wildone
      matchmany   =  *matchone
                       ; matches wildmany

Examples:

      a?c         ; Matches any string of 3 characters in length starting
                  with "a" and ending with "c"

      a*c         ; Matches any string of 2 or more characters in length
                  starting with "a" and ending with "c"

# <a href="#connection-registration" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connection Registration

Immediately upon establishing a connection the client must attempt registration, without waiting for any banner message from the server.

Until registration is complete, only a limited subset of commands SHOULD be accepted by the server. This is because it makes sense to require a registered (fully connected) client connection before allowing commands such as [`JOIN`](#join-message), [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) and others.

The recommended order of commands during registration is as follows:

1.  `CAP LS 302`
2.  `PASS`
3.  `NICK` and `USER`
4.  [Capability Negotiation](#capability-negotiation)
5.  `SASL` (if negotiated)
6.  `CAP END`

The commands specified in steps 1-3 should be sent on connection. If the server supports [capability negotiation](#capability-negotiation) then registration will be suspended and the client can negotiate client capabilities (steps 4-6). If the server does not support capability negotiation then registration will continue immediately without steps 4-6.

1.  If the server supports capability negotiation, the [`CAP`](#cap-message) command suspends the registration process and immediately starts the [capability negotiation](#capability-negotiation) process. `CAP LS 302` means that the client supports [version `302`](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/capability-negotiation.html#cap-ls-version) of client capability negotiation. The registration process is resumed when the client sends `CAP END` to the server.

2.  The [`PASS`](#pass-message) command is not required for the connection to be registered, but if included it MUST precede the latter of the [`NICK`](#nick-message) and [`USER`](#user-message) commands.

3.  The [`NICK`](#nick-message) and [`USER`](#user-message) commands are used to set the user’s nickname, username and “real name”. Unless the registration is suspended by a [`CAP`](#cap-message) negotiation, these commands will end the registration process.

4.  The client should request advertised capabilities it wishes to enable here.

5.  If the client supports [SASL authentication](#authenticate-message) and wishes to authenticate with the server, it should attempt this after a successful [`CAP ACK`](#cap-message) of the `sasl` capability is received and while registration is suspended.

6.  If the server support capability negotiation, [`CAP END`](#cap-message) will end the negotiation period and resume the registration.

If the server is waiting to complete a lookup of client information (such as hostname or ident for a username), there may be an arbitrary wait at some point during registration. Servers SHOULD set a reasonable timeout for these lookups.

Additionally, some servers also send a [`PING`](#ping-message) and require a matching [`PONG`](#pong-message) from the client before continuing. This exchange may happen immediately on connection and at any time during connection registration, so clients MUST respond correctly to it.

Upon successful completion of the registration process, the server MUST send, in this order:

1.  [`RPL_WELCOME`](#rplwelcome-001) `(001)`,
2.  [`RPL_YOURHOST`](#rplyourhost-002) `(002)`,
3.  [`RPL_CREATED`](#rplcreated-003) `(003)`,
4.  [`RPL_MYINFO`](#rplmyinfo-004) `(004)`,
5.  at least one [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#rplisupport-005) `(005)` numeric to the client.
6.  The server MAY then send other numerics and messages.
7.  The server SHOULD then respond as though the client sent the [`LUSERS`](#lusers-message) command and return the appropriate numerics.
8.  The server MUST then respond as though the client sent it the [`MOTD`](#motd-message) command, i.e. it must send either the successful [Message of the Day](#motd-message) numerics or the [`ERR_NOMOTD`](#errnomotd-422) `(422)` numeric.
9.  If the user has client modes set on them automatically upon joining the network, the server SHOULD send the client the [`RPL_UMODEIS`](#rplumodeis-221) `(221)` reply or a [`MODE`](#mode-message) message with the client as target, preferably the former.

The first parameter of the [`RPL_WELCOME`](#rplwelcome-001) `(001)` message is the nickname assigned by the network to the client. Since it may differ from the nickname the client requested with the `NICK` command (due to, e.g. length limits or policy restrictions on nicknames), the client SHOULD use this parameter to determine its actual nickname at the time of connection. Subsequent nickname changes, client-initiated or not, will be communicated by the server sending a [`NICK`](#nick-message) message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#feature-advertisement" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature Advertisement

IRC servers and networks implement many different IRC features, limits, and protocol options that clients should be aware of. The [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#rplisupport-005) `(005)` numeric is designed to advertise these features to clients on connection registration, providing a simple way for clients to change their behaviour based on what is implemented on the server.

Once client registration is complete, the server MUST send at least one `RPL_ISUPPORT` numeric to the client. The server MAY send more than one `RPL_ISUPPORT` numeric and consecutive `RPL_ISUPPORT` numerics SHOULD be sent adjacent to each other.

Clients SHOULD NOT assume a server supports a feature unless it has been advertised in `RPL_ISUPPORT`. For `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameters which specify a ‘default’ value, clients SHOULD assume the default value for these parameters until the server advertises these parameters itself. This is generally done for compatibility reasons with older versions of the IRC protocol that do not specify the `RPL_ISUPPORT` numeric and servers that do not advertise those specific tokens.

For more information and specific details on tokens, see the [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#rplisupport-005) `(005)` reply.

A list of `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameters is available in the [`RPL_ISUPPORT` Parameters](#rplisupport-parameters) section.

# <a href="#capability-negotiation" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Capability Negotiation

Over the years, various extensions to the IRC protocol have been made by server programmers. Often, these extensions are intended to conserve bandwidth, close loopholes left by the original protocol specification, or add new features for users or for server administrators. Most of these changes are backwards-compatible with the base protocol specifications: A command may be added, a reply may be extended to contain more parameters, etc. However, there are extensions which are designed to change protocol behaviour in a backwards-incompatible way.

Capability Negotiation is a mechanism for the negotiation of protocol extensions, known as **client capabilities**, that makes sure servers implementing backwards-incompatible protocol extensions still interoperate with existing clients, and vice-versa.

Clients implementing capability negotiation will still interoperate with servers that do not implement it; similarly, servers that implement capability negotiation will successfully communicate with clients that do not implement it.

IRC is an asynchronous protocol, which means that clients may issue additional IRC commands while previous commands are being processed. Additionally, there is no guarantee of a specific kind of banner being issued upon connection. Some servers also do not complain about unknown commands during registration, which means that a client cannot reliably do passive implementation discovery at registration time.

The solution to these problems is to allow for active capability negotiation, and to extend the registration process with this negotiation. If the server supports capability negotiation, the registration process will be suspended until negotiation is completed. If the server does not support this, then registration will complete immediately and the client will not use any capabilities.

Capability negotiation is started by the client issuing a `CAP LS 302` command (indicating to the server support for IRCv3.2 capability negotiation). Negotiation is then performed with the `CAP REQ`, `CAP ACK`, and `CAP NAK` commands, and is ended with the `CAP END` command.

If used during initial registration, and the server supports capability negotiation, the `CAP` command will suspend registration. Once capability negotiation has ended the registration process will continue.

Clients and servers should implement capability negotiation and the `CAP` command based on the [Capability Negotiation specification](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/capability-negotiation.html). Updates, improvements, and new versions of capability negotiation are managed by the [IRCv3 Working Group](http://ircv3.net/irc/).

# <a href="#client-messages" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client Messages

Messages are client-to-server only unless otherwise specified. If messages may be sent from the server to a connected client, it will be noted in the message’s description. For server-to-client messages of this type, the message `<source>` usually indicates the client the message relates to, but this will be noted in the description.

In message descriptions, ‘command’ refers to the message’s behaviour when sent from a client to the server. Similarly, ‘Command Examples’ represent example messages sent from a client to the server, and ‘Message Examples’ represent example messages sent from the server to a client. If a command is sent from a client to a server with less parameters than the command requires to be processed, the server will reply with an [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)` numeric and the command will fail.

In the `"Parameters:"` section, optional parts or parameters are noted with square brackets as such: `"[<param>]"`. Curly braces around a part of parameter indicate that it may be repeated zero or more times, for example: `"<key>{,<key>}"` indicates that there must be at least one `<key>`, and that there may be additional keys separated by the comma `(",", 0x2C)` character.

## <a href="#connection-messages" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connection Messages

### <a href="#cap-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CAP message

         Command: CAP
      Parameters: <subcommand> [:<capabilities>]

The `CAP` command is used for capability negotiation between a server and a client.

The `CAP` message may be sent from the server to the client.

For the exact semantics of the `CAP` command and subcommands, please see the [Capability Negotiation specification](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/capability-negotiation.html).

### <a href="#authenticate-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AUTHENTICATE message

         Command: AUTHENTICATE

The `AUTHENTICATE` command is used for SASL authentication between a server and a client. The client must support and successfully negotiate the `"sasl"` client capability (as listed below in the SASL specifications) before using this command.

The `AUTHENTICATE` message may be sent from the server to the client.

For the exact semantics of the `AUTHENTICATE` command and negotiating support for the `"sasl"` client capability, please see the [IRCv3.1](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.1.html) and [IRCv3.2](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.2.html) SASL Authentication specifications.

### <a href="#pass-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PASS message

         Command: PASS
      Parameters: <password>

The `PASS` command is used to set a ‘connection password’. If set, the password must be set before any attempt to register the connection is made. This requires that clients send a `PASS` command before sending the `NICK` / `USER` combination.

The password supplied must match the one defined in the server configuration. It is possible to send multiple `PASS` commands before registering but only the last one sent is used for verification and it may not be changed once the client has been registered.

If the password supplied does not match the password expected by the server, then the server SHOULD send [`ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH`](#errpasswdmismatch-464) `(464)` and MAY then close the connection with [`ERROR`](#error-message). Servers MUST send at least one of these two messages.

Servers may also consider requiring [SASL authentication](#authenticate-message) upon connection as an alternative to this, when more information or an alternate form of identity verification is desired.

Numeric replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED`](#erralreadyregistered-462) `(462)`
-   [`ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH`](#errpasswdmismatch-464) `(464)`

Command Example:

      PASS secretpasswordhere

### <a href="#nick-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NICK message

         Command: NICK
      Parameters: <nickname>

The `NICK` command is used to give the client a nickname or change the previous one.

If the server receives a `NICK` command from a client where the desired nickname is already in use on the network, it should issue an `ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE` numeric and ignore the `NICK` command.

If the server does not accept the new nickname supplied by the client as valid (for instance, due to containing invalid characters), it should issue an `ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME` numeric and ignore the `NICK` command. Servers MUST allow at least all alphanumerical characters, square and curly brackets (`[]{}`), backslashes (`\`), and pipe (`|`) characters in nicknames, and MAY disallow digits as the first character. Servers MAY allow extra characters, as long as they do not introduce ambiguity in other commands, including:

-   no leading `#` character or other character advertized in [`CHANTYPES`](#chantypes-parameter)
-   no leading colon (`:`)
-   no ASCII space

If the server does not receive the `<nickname>` parameter with the `NICK` command, it should issue an `ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN` numeric and ignore the `NICK` command.

The `NICK` message may be sent from the server to clients to acknowledge their `NICK` command was successful, and to inform other clients about the change of nickname. In these cases, the `<source>` of the message will be the old `nickname [ [ "!" user ] "@" host ]` of the user who is changing their nickname.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN`](#errnonicknamegiven-431) `(431)`
-   [`ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME`](#errerroneusnickname-432) `(432)`
-   [`ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE`](#errnicknameinuse-433) `(433)`
-   [`ERR_NICKCOLLISION`](#errnickcollision-436) `(436)`

Command Example:

      NICK Wiz                  ; Requesting the new nick "Wiz".

Message Examples:

      :WiZ NICK Kilroy          ; WiZ changed his nickname to Kilroy.

      :dan-!d@localhost NICK Mamoped
                                ; dan- changed his nickname to Mamoped.

### <a href="#user-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>USER message

         Command: USER
      Parameters: <username> 0 * <realname>

The `USER` command is used at the beginning of a connection to specify the username and realname of a new user.

It must be noted that `<realname>` must be the last parameter because it may contain SPACE `(' ',` `0x20)` characters, and should be prefixed with a colon (`:`) if required.

Servers MAY use the [Ident Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1413) to look up the ‘real username’ of clients. If username lookups are enabled and a client does not have an Identity Server enabled, the username provided by the client SHOULD be prefixed by a tilde `('~', 0x7E)` to show that this value is user-set.

The maximum length of `<username>` may be specified by the [`USERLEN`](#userlen-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter. If this length is advertised, the username MUST be silently truncated to the given length before being used. The minimum length of `<username>` is 1, ie. it MUST NOT be empty. If it is empty, the server SHOULD reject the command with [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) (even if an empty parameter is provided); otherwise it MUST use a default value instead.

The second and third parameters of this command SHOULD be sent as one zero `('0', 0x30)` and one asterisk character `('*', 0x2A)` by the client, as the meaning of these two parameters varies between different versions of the IRC protocol.

Clients SHOULD use the nickname as a fallback value for `<username>` and `<realname>` when they don’t have a meaningful value to use.

If a client tries to send the `USER` command after they have already completed registration with the server, the `ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED` reply should be sent and the attempt should fail.

If the client sends a `USER` command after the server has successfully received a username using the Ident Protocol, the `<username>` parameter from this command should be ignored in favour of the one received from the identity server.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED`](#erralreadyregistered-462) `(462)`

Command Examples:

      USER guest 0 * :Ronnie Reagan
                                  ; No ident server
                                  ; User gets registered with username
                                  "~guest" and real name "Ronnie Reagan"

      USER guest 0 * :Ronnie Reagan
                                  ; Ident server gets contacted and
                                  returns the name "danp"
                                  ; User gets registered with username
                                  "danp" and real name "Ronnie Reagan"

### <a href="#ping-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PING message

         Command: PING
      Parameters: <token>

The `PING` command is sent by either clients or servers to check the other side of the connection is still connected and/or to check for connection latency, at the application layer.

The `<token>` may be any non-empty string.

When receiving a `PING` message, clients or servers must reply to it with a [`PONG`](#pong-message) message with the same `<token>` value. This allows either to match `PONG` with the `PING` they reply to, for example to compute latency.

Clients should not send `PING` during connection registration, though servers may accept it. Servers may send `PING` during connection registration and clients must reply to them.

Older versions of the protocol gave specific semantics to the `<token>` and allowed an extra parameter; but these features are not consistently implemented and should not be relied on. Instead, the `<token>` should be treated as an opaque value by the receiver.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_NOORIGIN`](#errnoorigin-409) `(409)`

Deprecated Numeric Reply:

### <a href="#pong-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PONG message

         Command: PONG
      Parameters: [<server>] <token>

The `PONG` command is used as a reply to [`PING`](#ping-message) commands, by both clients and servers. The `<token>` should be the same as the one in the `PING` message that triggered this `PONG`.

Servers MUST send a `<server>` parameter, and clients SHOULD ignore it. It exists for historical reasons, and indicates the name of the server sending the PONG. Clients MUST NOT send a `<server>` parameter.

Numeric Replies:

-   None

### <a href="#oper-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OPER message

         Command: OPER
      Parameters: <name> <password>

The `OPER` command is used by a normal user to obtain IRC operator privileges. Both parameters are required for the command to be successful.

If the client does not send the correct password for the given name, the server replies with an `ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH` message and the request is not successful.

If the client is not connecting from a valid host for the given name, the server replies with an `ERR_NOOPERHOST` message and the request is not successful.

If the supplied name and password are both correct, and the user is connecting from a valid host, the `RPL_YOUREOPER` message is sent to the user. The user will also receive a [`MODE`](#mode-message) message indicating their new user modes, and other messages may be sent.

The `<name>` specified by this command is separate to the accounts specified by SASL authentication, and is generally stored in the IRCd configuration.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH`](#errpasswdmismatch-464) `(464)`
-   [`ERR_NOOPERHOST`](#errnooperhost-491) `(491)`
-   [`RPL_YOUREOPER`](#rplyoureoper-381) `(381)`

Command Example:

      OPER foo bar                ; Attempt to register as an operator
                                  using a name of "foo" and the password "bar".

### <a href="#quit-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>QUIT message

        Command: QUIT
     Parameters: [<reason>]

The `QUIT` command is used to terminate a client’s connection to the server. The server acknowledges this by replying with an [`ERROR`](#error-message) message and closing the connection to the client.

This message may also be sent from the server to a client to show that a client has exited from the network. This is typically only dispatched to clients that share a channel with the exiting user. When the `QUIT` message is sent to clients, `<source>` represents the client that has exited the network.

When connections are terminated by a client-sent `QUIT` command, servers SHOULD prepend `<reason>` with the ASCII string `"Quit: "` when sending `QUIT` messages to other clients, to represent that this user terminated the connection themselves. This applies even if `<reason>` is empty, in which case the reason sent to other clients SHOULD be just this `"Quit: "` string. However, clients SHOULD NOT change behaviour based on the prefix of `QUIT` message reasons, as this is not required behaviour from servers.

When a netsplit (the disconnecting of two servers) occurs, a `QUIT` message is generated for each client that has exited the network, distributed in the same way as ordinary `QUIT` messages. The `<reason>` on these `QUIT` messages SHOULD be composed of the names of the two servers involved, separated by a SPACE `(' ', 0x20)`. The first name is that of the server which is still connected and the second name is that of the server which has become disconnected. If servers wish to hide or obscure the names of the servers involved, the `<reason>` on these messages MAY also be the literal ASCII string `"*.net *.split"` (i.e. the two server names are replaced with `"*.net"` and `"*.split"`). Software that implements the IRCv3 [`batch` Extension](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch-3.2.html) should also look at the [`netsplit` and `netjoin`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch/netsplit-3.2.html) batch types.

If a client connection is closed without the client issuing a `QUIT` command to the server, the server MUST distribute a `QUIT` message to other clients informing them of this, distributed in the same was an ordinary `QUIT` message. Servers MUST fill `<reason>` with a message reflecting the nature of the event which caused it to happen. For instance, `"Ping timeout: 120 seconds"`, `"Excess Flood"`, and `"Too many connections from this IP"` are examples of relevant reasons for closing or for a connection with a client to have been closed.

Message Example:

      :dan-!d@localhost QUIT :Quit: Bye for now!
                                       ; dan- is exiting the network with
                                       the message: "Quit: Bye for now!"

### <a href="#error-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ERROR message

        Command: ERROR
     Parameters: <reason>

This message is sent from a server to a client to report a fatal error, before terminating the client’s connection.

This MUST only be used to report fatal errors. Regular errors should use the appropriate numerics or the IRCv3 [standard replies](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/standard-replies) framework.

Numeric Replies:

-   None

Command Example:

      ERROR :Connection timeout        ; Server closing a client connection because it
                                       is unresponsive.

## <a href="#channel-operations" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel Operations

This group of messages is concerned with manipulating channels, their properties (channel modes), and their contents (typically clients).

These commands may be requests to the server, in which case the server will or will not grant the request. If a ‘request’ is granted, it will be acknowledged by the server sending a message containing the same information back to the client. This is to tell the user that the request was successful. These sort of ‘request’ commands will be noted in the message information.

In implementing these messages, race conditions are inevitable when clients at opposing ends of a network send commands which will ultimately clash. Server-to-server protocols should be aware of this and make sure their protocol ensures consistent state across the entire network.

### <a href="#join-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JOIN message

         Command: JOIN
      Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]
      Alt Params: 0

The `JOIN` command indicates that the client wants to join the given channel(s), each channel using the given key for it. The server receiving the command checks whether or not the client can join the given channel, and processes the request. Servers MUST process the parameters of this command as lists on incoming commands from clients, with the first `<key>` being used for the first `<channel>`, the second `<key>` being used for the second `<channel>`, etc.

While a client is joined to a channel, they receive all relevant information about that channel including the `JOIN`, `PART`, `KICK`, and `MODE` messages affecting the channel. They receive all `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` messages sent to the channel, and they also receive `QUIT` messages from other clients joined to the same channel (to let them know those users have left the channel and the network). This allows them to keep track of other channel members and channel modes.

If a client’s `JOIN` command to the server is successful, the server MUST send, in this order:

1.  A `JOIN` message with the client as the message `<source>` and the channel they have joined as the first parameter of the message.
2.  The channel’s topic (with [`RPL_TOPIC`](#rpltopic-332) `(332)` and optionally [`RPL_TOPICWHOTIME`](#rpltopicwhotime-333) `(333)`), and no message if the channel does not have a topic.
3.  A list of users currently joined to the channel (with one or more [`RPL_NAMREPLY`](#rplnamreply-353) `(353)` numerics followed by a single [`RPL_ENDOFNAMES`](#rplendofnames-366) `(366)` numeric). These `RPL_NAMREPLY` messages sent by the server MUST include the requesting client that has just joined the channel.

The [key](#key-channel-mode), [client limit](#client-limit-channel-mode) , [ban](#ban-channel-mode) - [exception](#ban-exception-channel-mode), [invite-only](#invite-only-channel-mode) - [exception](#invite-exception-channel-mode), and other (depending on server software) channel modes affect whether or not a given client may join a channel. More information on each of these modes and how they affect the `JOIN` command is available in their respective sections.

Servers MAY restrict the number of channels a client may be joined to at one time. This limit SHOULD be defined in the [`CHANLIMIT`](#chanlimit-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter. If the client cannot join this channel because they would be over their limit, they will receive an [`ERR_TOOMANYCHANNELS`](#errtoomanychannels-405) `(405)` reply and the command will fail.

Note that this command also accepts the special argument of `("0", 0x30)` instead of any of the usual parameters, which requests that the sending client leave all channels they are currently connected to. The server will process this command as though the client had sent a [`PART`](#part-message) command for each channel they are a member of.

This message may be sent from a server to a client to notify the client that someone has joined a channel. In this case, the message `<source>` will be the client who is joining, and `<channel>` will be the channel which that client has joined. Servers SHOULD NOT send multiple channels in this message to clients, and SHOULD distribute these multiple-channel `JOIN` messages as a series of messages with a single channel name on each.

### <a href="#part-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PART message

         Command: PART
      Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<reason>]

The `PART` command removes the client from the given channel(s). On sending a successful `PART` command, the user will receive a `PART` message from the server for each channel they have been removed from. `<reason>` is the reason that the client has left the channel(s).

For each channel in the parameter of this command, if the channel exists and the client is not joined to it, they will receive an [`ERR_NOTONCHANNEL`](#errnotonchannel-442) `(442)` reply and that channel will be ignored. If the channel does not exist, the client will receive an [`ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL`](#errnosuchchannel-403) `(403)` reply and that channel will be ignored.

This message may be sent from a server to a client to notify the client that someone has been removed from a channel. In this case, the message `<source>` will be the client who is being removed, and `<channel>` will be the channel which that client has been removed from. Servers SHOULD NOT send multiple channels in this message to clients, and SHOULD distribute these multiple-channel `PART` messages as a series of messages with a single channel name on each. If a `PART` message is distributed in this way, `<reason>` (if it exists) should be on each of these messages.

### <a href="#topic-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TOPIC message

         Command: TOPIC
      Parameters: <channel> [<topic>]

The `TOPIC` command is used to change or view the topic of the given channel. If `<topic>` is not given, either `RPL_TOPIC` or `RPL_NOTOPIC` is returned specifying the current channel topic or lack of one. If `<topic>` is an empty string, the topic for the channel will be cleared.

If the client sending this command is not joined to the given channel, and tries to view its’ topic, the server MAY return the [`ERR_NOTONCHANNEL`](#errnotonchannel-442) `(442)` numeric and have the command fail.

If `RPL_TOPIC` is returned to the client sending this command, `RPL_TOPICWHOTIME` SHOULD also be sent to that client.

If the [protected topic](#protected-topic-mode) mode is set on a channel, then clients MUST have appropriate channel permissions to modify the topic of that channel. If a client does not have appropriate channel permissions and tries to change the topic, the [`ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED`](#errchanoprivsneeded-482) `(482)` numeric is returned and the command will fail.

If the topic of a channel is changed or cleared, every client in that channel (including the author of the topic change) will receive a `TOPIC` command with the new topic as argument (or an empty argument if the topic was cleared) alerting them to how the topic has changed. If the `<topic>` param is provided but the same as the previous topic (ie. it is unchanged), servers MAY notify the author and/or other users anyway.

Clients joining the channel in the future will receive a `RPL_TOPIC` numeric (or lack thereof) accordingly.

### <a href="#names-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NAMES message

         Command: NAMES
      Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>}

The `NAMES` command is used to view the nicknames joined to a channel and their [channel membership prefixes](#channel-membership-prefixes). The param of this command is a list of channel names, delimited by a comma `(",", 0x2C)` character.

The channel names are evaluated one-by-one. For each channel that exists and they are able to see the users in, the server returns one of more `RPL_NAMREPLY` numerics containing the users joined to the channel and a single `RPL_ENDOFNAMES` numeric. If the channel name is invalid or the channel does not exist, one `RPL_ENDOFNAMES` numeric containing the given channel name should be returned. If the given channel has the [secret](#secret-channel-mode) channel mode set and the user is not joined to that channel, one `RPL_ENDOFNAMES` numeric is returned. Users with the [invisible](#invisible-user-mode) user mode set are not shown in channel responses unless the requesting client is also joined to that channel.

Servers MAY allow more than one target channel. They can advertise the maximum the number of target users per `NAMES` command via the [`TARGMAX`](#targmax-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter.

### <a href="#list-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LIST message

         Command: LIST
      Parameters: [<channel>{,<channel>}] [<elistcond>{,<elistcond>}]

The `LIST` command is used to get a list of channels along with some information about each channel. Both parameters to this command are optional as they have different syntaxes.

The first possible parameter to this command is a list of channel names, delimited by a comma `(",", 0x2C)` character. If this parameter is given, the information for only the given channels is returned. If this parameter is not given, the information about all visible channels (those not hidden by the [secret](#secret-channel-mode) channel mode rules) is returned.

The second possible parameter to this command is a list of conditions as defined in the [`ELIST`](#elist-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter, delimited by a comma `(",", 0x2C)` character. Clients MUST NOT submit an `ELIST` condition unless the server has explicitly defined support for that condition with the `ELIST` token. If this parameter is supplied, the server filters the returned list of channels with the given conditions as specified in the [`ELIST`](#elist-parameter) documentation.

In response to a successful `LIST` command, the server MAY send one `RPL_LISTSTART` numeric, MUST send back zero or more `RPL_LIST` numerics, and MUST send back one `RPL_LISTEND` numeric.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`RPL_LISTSTART`](#rplliststart-321) `(321)`

### <a href="#invite-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INVITE message

         Command: INVITE
      Parameters: <nickname> <channel>

The `INVITE` command is used to invite a user to a channel. The parameter `<nickname>` is the nickname of the person to be invited to the target channel `<channel>`.

The target channel SHOULD exist (at least one user is on it). Otherwise, the server SHOULD reject the command with the `ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL` numeric.

Only members of the channel are allowed to invite other users. Otherwise, the server MUST reject the command with the `ERR_NOTONCHANNEL` numeric.

Servers MAY reject the command with the `ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED` numeric. In particular, they SHOULD reject it when the channel has [invite-only](#invite-only-channel-mode) mode set, and the user is not a channel operator.

If the user is already on the target channel, the server MUST reject the command with the `ERR_USERONCHANNEL` numeric.

When the invite is successful, the server MUST send a `RPL_INVITING` numeric to the command issuer, and an `INVITE` message, with the issuer as `<source>`, to the target user. Other channel members SHOULD NOT be notified.

#### <a href="#invite-list" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Invite list

Servers MAY allow the `INVITE` with no parameter, and reply with a list of channels the sender is invited to as [`RPL_INVITELIST`](#rplinvitelist-336) `(336)` numerics, ending with a [`RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST`](#rplendofinvitelist-337) `(337)` numeric.

Some rare implementations use numerics 346/347 instead of 336/337 as \`RPL\_INVITELIST\`/\`RPL\_ENDOFINVITELIST\`. You should check the server you are using implements them as expected.

346/347 now generally stands for \`RPL\_INVEXLIST\`/\`RPL\_ENDOFINVEXLIST\`, used for [invite-exception list](#invite-exception-channel-mode).

### <a href="#kick-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>KICK message

          Command: KICK
       Parameters: <channel> <user> *( "," <user> ) [<comment>]

The KICK command can be used to request the forced removal of a user from a channel. It causes the `<user>` to be removed from the `<channel>` by force.

This message may be sent from a server to a client to notify the client that someone has been removed from a channel. In this case, the message `<source>` will be the client who sent the kick, and `<channel>` will be the channel which the target client has been removed from.

If no comment is given, the server SHOULD use a default message instead.

Servers MUST NOT send multiple users in this message to clients, and MUST distribute these multiple-user `KICK` messages as a series of messages with a single user name on each. This is necessary to maintain backward compatibility with existing client software. If a `KICK` message is distributed in this way, `<comment>` (if it exists) should be on each of these messages.

Servers MAY limit the number of target users per `KICK` command via the [`TARGMAX` parameter of `RPL_ISUPPORT`](#targmax-parameter), and silently drop targets if the number of targets exceeds the limit.

         Command: VERSION
      Parameters: [<target>]

The `VERSION` command is used to query the version of the software and the [`RPL_ISUPPORT` parameters](#rplisupport-parameters) of the given server. If `<target>` is not given, the information for the server the client is connected to should be returned.

If `<target>` is a server, the information for that server is requested. If `<target>` is a client, the information for the server that client is connected to is requested. If `<target>` is given and a matching server cannot be found, the server will respond with the `ERR_NOSUCHSERVER` numeric and the command will fail.

Wildcards are allowed in the `<target>` parameter.

Upon receiving a `VERSION` command, the given server SHOULD respond with one `RPL_VERSION` reply and one or more `RPL_ISUPPORT` replies.

### <a href="#stats-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STATS message

         Command: STATS
      Parameters: <query> [<server>]

The `STATS` command is used to query statistics of a certain server. The specific queries supported by this command depend on the server that replies, although the server must be able to supply information as described by the queries below (or similar).

A query may be given by any single letter which is only checked by the destination server and is otherwise passed on by intermediate servers, ignored and unaltered.

The following queries are those found in current IRC implementations and provide a large portion of the setup and runtime information for that server. All servers should be able to supply a valid reply to a `STATS` query which is consistent with the reply formats currently used and the purpose of the query.

The currently supported queries are:

-   `c` - returns a list of servers which the server may connect to or allow connections from;
-   `h` - returns a list of servers which are either forced to be treated as leaves or allowed to act as hubs;
-   `i` - returns a list of hosts which the server allows a client to connect from;
-   `k` - returns a list of banned username/hostname combinations for that server;
-   `l` - returns a list of the server’s connections, showing how long each connection has been established and the traffic over that connection in bytes and messages for each direction;
-   `m` - returns a list of commands supported by the server and the usage count for each if the usage count is non zero;
-   `o` - returns a list of hosts from which normal clients may become operators;
-   `u` - returns a string showing how long the server has been up.
-   `y` - show Y (Class) lines from server’s configuration file;

Need to give this a good look-over. It's probably quite incorrect.

### <a href="#help-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HELP message

         Command: HELP
      Parameters: [<subject>]

The `HELP` command is used to return documentation about the IRC server and the IRC commands it implements.

When receiving a `HELP` command, servers MUST either: reply with a single [`ERR_HELPNOTFOUND`](#errhelpnotfound-524) `(524)` message; or reply with a single [`RPL_HELPSTART`](#rplhelpstart-704) `(704)` message, then arbitrarily many [`RPL_HELPTXT`](#rplhelptxt-705) `(705)` messages, then a single [`RPL_ENDOFHELP`](#rplendofhelp-706) `(706)`. Servers MAY return the [`RPL_HELPTXT`](#rplhelptxt-705) `(705)` form for unknown subjects, especially if their reply would not fit in a single line.

The [`RPL_HELPSTART`](#rplhelpstart-704) `(704)` message SHOULD be some sort of title and the first [`RPL_HELPTXT`](#rplhelptxt-705) `(705)` message SHOULD be empty. This is what most servers do today.

Servers MAY define any `<subject>` they want. Servers typically have documentation for most of the IRC commands they support.

Clients SHOULD gracefully handle older servers that reply to `HELP` with a set of [`NOTICE`](#notice-message) messages. On these servers, the client may try sending the `HELPOP` command (with the same syntax specified here), which may return the numeric-based reply.

Clients SHOULD also gracefully handle servers that reply to `HELP` with a set of `290`/`291`/`292`/`293`/`294`/`295` numerics.

Numerics:

-   [`ERR_HELPNOTFOUND`](#errhelpnotfound-524) `(524)`
-   [`RPL_HELPSTART`](#rplhelpstart-704) `(704)`
-   [`RPL_HELPTXT`](#rplhelptxt-705) `(705)`
-   [`RPL_ENDOFHELP`](#rplendofhelp-706) `(706)`

Command Examples:

      HELP                                                     ; request generic help

### <a href="#info-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INFO message

         Command: INFO
      Parameters: None

The `INFO` command is used to return information which describes the server. This information usually includes the software name/version and its authors. Some other info that may be returned includes the patch level and compile date of the server, the copyright on the server software, and whatever miscellaneous information the server authors consider relevant.

Upon receiving an `INFO` command, the server will respond with zero or more `RPL_INFO` replies, followed by one `RPL_ENDOFINFO` numeric.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`RPL_INFO`](#rplinfo-371) `(371)`
-   [`RPL_ENDOFINFO`](#rplendofinfo-374) `(374)`

Command Examples:

     INFO                            ; request info from the server

### <a href="#mode-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MODE message

         Command: MODE
      Parameters: <target> [<modestring> [<mode arguments>...]]

The `MODE` command is used to set or remove options (or *modes*) from a given target.

#### <a href="#user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User mode

If `<target>` is a nickname that does not exist on the network, the [`ERR_NOSUCHNICK`](#errnosuchnick-401) `(401)` numeric is returned. If `<target>` is a different nick than the user who sent the command, the [`ERR_USERSDONTMATCH`](#errusersdontmatch-502) `(502)` numeric is returned.

If `<modestring>` is not given, the [`RPL_UMODEIS`](#rplumodeis-221) `(221)` numeric is sent back containing the current modes of the target user.

If `<modestring>` is given, the supplied modes will be applied, and a `MODE` message will be sent to the user containing the changed modes. If one or more modes sent are not implemented on the server, the server MUST apply the modes that are implemented, and then send the [`ERR_UMODEUNKNOWNFLAG`](#errumodeunknownflag-501) `(501)` in reply along with the `MODE` message.

#### <a href="#channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel mode

If `<target>` is a channel that does not exist on the network, the [`ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL`](#errnosuchchannel-403) `(403)` numeric is returned.

If `<modestring>` is not given, the [`RPL_CHANNELMODEIS`](#rplchannelmodeis-324) `(324)` numeric is returned. Servers MAY choose to hide sensitive information such as channel keys when sending the current modes. Servers MAY also return the [`RPL_CREATIONTIME`](#rplcreationtime-329) `(329)` numeric following `RPL_CHANNELMODEIS`.

If `<modestring>` is given, the user sending the command MUST have appropriate channel privileges on the target channel to change the modes given. If a user does not have appropriate privileges to change modes on the target channel, the server MUST NOT process the message, and [`ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED`](#errchanoprivsneeded-482) `(482)` numeric is returned. If the user has permission to change modes on the target, the supplied modes will be applied based on the type of the mode (see below). For type A, B, and C modes, arguments will be sequentially obtained from `<mode arguments>`. If a type B or C mode does not have a parameter when being set, the server MUST ignore that mode. If a type A mode has been sent without an argument, the contents of the list MUST be sent to the user, unless it contains sensitive information the user is not allowed to access. When the server is done processing the modes, a `MODE` command is sent to all members of the channel containing the mode changes. Servers MAY choose to hide sensitive information when sending the mode changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`<modestring>` starts with a plus `('+',` `0x2B)` or minus `('-',` `0x2D)` character, and is made up of the following characters:

-   **`'+'`**: Adds the following mode(s).
-   **`'-'`**: Removes the following mode(s).
-   **`'a-zA-Z'`**: Mode letters, indicating which modes are to be added/removed.

The ABNF representation for `<modestring>` is:

      modestring  =  1*( modeset )
      modeset     =  plusminus *( modechar )
      plusminus   =  %x2B / %x2D
                       ; + or -
      modechar    =  ALPHA

There are four categories of channel modes, defined as follows:

-   **Type A**: Modes that add or remove an address to or from a list. These modes MUST always have a parameter when sent from the server to a client. A client MAY issue this type of mode without an argument to obtain the current contents of the list. The numerics used to retrieve contents of Type A modes depends on the specific mode. Also see the [`EXTBAN`](#extban-parameter) parameter.
-   **Type B**: Modes that change a setting on a channel. These modes MUST always have a parameter.
-   **Type C**: Modes that change a setting on a channel. These modes MUST have a parameter when being set, and MUST NOT have a parameter when being unset.
-   **Type D**: Modes that change a setting on a channel. These modes MUST NOT have a parameter.

Channel mode letters, along with their types, are defined in the [`CHANMODES`](#chanmodes-parameter) parameter. User mode letters are always **Type D** modes.

The meaning of standard (and/or well-used) channel and user mode letters can be found in the [Channel Modes](#channel-modes) and [User Modes](#user-modes) sections. The meaning of any mode letters not in this list are defined by the server software and configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type A modes are lists that can be viewed. The method of viewing these lists is not standardised across modes and different numerics are used for each. The specific numerics used for these are outlined here:

-   **[Ban List `"+b"`](#ban-channel-mode)**: Ban lists are returned with zero or more [`RPL_BANLIST`](#rplbanlist-367) `(367)` numerics, followed by one [`RPL_ENDOFBANLIST`](#rplendofbanlist-368) `(368)` numeric.
-   **[Exception List `"+e"`](#exception-channel-mode)**: Exception lists are returned with zero or more [`RPL_EXCEPTLIST`](#rplexceptlist-348) `(348)` numerics, followed by one [`RPL_ENDOFEXCEPTLIST`](#rplendofexceptlist-349) `(349)` numeric.
-   **[Invite-Exception List `"+I"`](#invite-exception-channel-mode)**: Invite-exception lists are returned with zero or more [`RPL_INVITELIST`](#rplinvitelist-336) `(336)` numerics, followed by one [`RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST`](#rplendofinvitelist-337) `(337)` numeric.

After the initial `MODE` command is sent to the server, the client receives the above numerics detailing the entries that appear on the given list. Servers MAY choose to restrict the above information to channel operators, or to only those clients who have permissions to change the given list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command Examples:

      MODE dan +i                     ; Setting the "invisible" user mode on dan.

      MODE #foobar +mb *@127.0.0.1    ; Setting the "moderated" channel mode and
                                      adding the "*@127.0.0.1" mask to the ban
                                      list of the #foobar channel.

Message Examples:

      :dan!~h@localhost MODE #foobar -bl+i *@192.168.0.1
                                      ; dan unbanned the "*@192.168.0.1" mask,
                                      removed the client limit from, and set the
                                      #foobar channel to invite-only.

      :irc.example.com MODE #foobar +o bunny
                                      ; The irc.example.com server gave channel
                                      operator privileges to bunny on #foobar.

### <a href="#privmsg-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PRIVMSG message

         Command: PRIVMSG
      Parameters: <target>{,<target>} <text to be sent>

The `PRIVMSG` command is used to send private messages between users, as well as to send messages to channels. `<target>` is the nickname of a client or the name of a channel.

If `<target>` is a channel name and the client is [banned](#ban-channel-mode) and not covered by a [ban exception](#ban-exception-channel-mode), the message will not be delivered and the command will silently fail. Channels with the [moderated](#moderated-channel-mode) mode active may block messages from certain users. Other channel modes may affect the delivery of the message or cause the message to be modified before delivery, and these modes are defined by the server software and configuration being used.

If a message cannot be delivered to a channel, the server SHOULD respond with an [`ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN`](#errcannotsendtochan-404) `(404)` numeric to let the user know that this message could not be delivered.

If `<target>` is a channel name, it may be prefixed with one or more [channel membership prefix character (`@`, `+`, etc)](#channel-membership-prefixes) and the message will be delivered only to the members of that channel with the given or higher status in the channel. Servers that support this feature will list the prefixes which this is supported for in the [`STATUSMSG`](#statusmsg-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter, and this SHOULD NOT be attempted by clients unless the prefix has been advertised in this token.

If `<target>` is a user and that user has been set as away, the server may reply with an [`RPL_AWAY`](#rplaway-301) `(301)` numeric and the command will continue.

The `PRIVMSG` message is sent from the server to client to deliver a message to that client. The `<source>` of the message represents the user or server that sent the message, and the `<target>` represents the target of that `PRIVMSG` (which may be the client, a channel, etc).

When the `PRIVMSG` message is sent from a server to a client and `<target>` starts with a dollar character `('$', 0x24)`, the message is a broadcast sent to all clients on one or multiple servers.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NOSUCHNICK`](#errnosuchnick-401) `(401)`
-   [`ERR_NOSUCHSERVER`](#errnosuchserver-402) `(402)`
-   [`ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN`](#errcannotsendtochan-404) `(404)`
-   ERR\_TOOMANYTARGETS (407)
-   [`ERR_NORECIPIENT`](#errnorecipient-411) `(411)`
-   [`ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND`](#errnotexttosend-412) `(412)`
-   ERR\_NOTOPLEVEL (413)
-   ERR\_WILDTOPLEVEL (414)
-   [`RPL_AWAY`](#rplaway-301) `(301)`

There are strange "X@Y" target rules and such which are noted in the examples of the original PRIVMSG RFC section. We need to check to make sure modern servers actually process them properly, and if so then specify them.

Command Examples:

      PRIVMSG Angel :yes I'm receiving it !
                                      ; Command to send a message to Angel.

      PRIVMSG %#bunny :Hi! I have a problem!
                                      ; Command to send a message to halfops
                                      and chanops on #bunny.

      PRIVMSG @%#bunny :Hi! I have a problem!
                                      ; Command to send a message to halfops
                                      and chanops on #bunny. This command is
                                      functionally identical to the above
                                      command.

Message Examples:

      :Angel PRIVMSG Wiz :Hello are you receiving this message ?
                                      ; Message from Angel to Wiz.

      :dan!~h@localhost PRIVMSG #coolpeople :Hi everyone!
                                      ; Message from dan to the channel
                                      #coolpeople

### <a href="#notice-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NOTICE message

         Command: NOTICE
      Parameters: <target>{,<target>} <text to be sent>

The `NOTICE` command is used to send notices between users, as well as to send notices to channels. `<target>` is interpreted the same way as it is for the [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) command.

The `NOTICE` message is used similarly to [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message). The difference between `NOTICE` and [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) is that automatic replies must never be sent in response to a `NOTICE` message. This rule also applies to servers – they must not send any error back to the client on receipt of a `NOTICE` command. The intention of this is to avoid loops between a client automatically sending something in response to something it received. This is typically used by ‘bots’ (a client with a program, and not a user, controlling their actions) and also for server messages to clients.

One thing for bot authors to note is that the `NOTICE` message may be interpreted differently by various clients. Some clients highlight or interpret any `NOTICE` sent to a channel in the same way that a `PRIVMSG` with their nickname gets interpreted. This means that users may be irritated by the use of `NOTICE` messages rather than `PRIVMSG` messages by clients or bots, and they are not commonly used by client bots for this reason.

### <a href="#who-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHO message

         Command: WHO
      Parameters: <mask>

This command is used to query a list of users who match the provided mask. The server will answer this command with zero, one or more [`RPL_WHOREPLY`](#rplwhoreply-352), and end the list with [`RPL_ENDOFWHO`](#rplendofwho-315).

The mask can be one of the following:

-   A channel name, in which case the channel members are listed.
-   An exact nickname, in which case a single user is returned.
-   A mask pattern, in which case all visible users whose nickname matches are listed. Servers MAY match other user-specific values, such as the hostname, server, real name or username. Servers MAY not support mask patterns and return an empty list.

Visible users are users who either aren’t invisible ([user mode `+i`](#invisible-user-mode)) or have a common channel with the requesting client. Servers MAY filter or limit visible users replies arbitrarily.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`RPL_WHOREPLY`](#rplwhoreply-352) `(352)`
-   [`RPL_ENDOFWHO`](#rplendofwho-315) `(315)`

### <a href="#whois-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHOIS message

         Command: WHOIS
      Parameters: [<target>] <nick>

This command is used to query information about a particular user. The server SHOULD answer this command with numeric messages with information about the nick.

The server SHOULD end its response (to a syntactically well-formed client message) with [`RPL_ENDOFWHOIS`](#rplendofwhois-318), even if it did not send any other numeric message. This allows clients to stop waiting for new numerics. In exceptional error conditions, servers MAY not reply to a `WHOIS` command. Clients SHOULD implement a hard timeout to avoid waiting for a reply which won’t come.

Client MUST NOT not assume all numeric messages are sent at once, as server can interleave other messages before the end of the WHOIS response.

If the `<target>` parameter is specified, it SHOULD be a server name or the nick of a user. Servers SHOULD send the query to a specific server with that name, or to the server `<target>` is connected to, respectively. Typically, it is used by clients who want to know how long the user in question has been idle (as typically only the server the user is directly connected to knows that information, while everything else this command returns is globally known).

The following numerics MAY be returned as part of the whois reply:

-   [`ERR_NOSUCHNICK`](#errnosuchnick-401) `(401)`
-   [`ERR_NOSUCHSERVER`](#errnosuchserver-402) `(402)`
-   [`ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN`](#errnonicknamegiven-431) `(431)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISCERTFP`](#rplwhoiscertfp-276) `(276)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISREGNICK`](#rplwhoisregnick-307) `(307)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISUSER`](#rplwhoisuser-311) `(311)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISSERVER`](#rplwhoisserver-312) `(312)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISOPERATOR`](#rplwhoisoperator-313) `(313)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISIDLE`](#rplwhoisidle-317) `(317)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISCHANNELS`](#rplwhoischannels-319) `(319)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISSPECIAL`](#rplwhoisspecial-320) `(320)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISACCOUNT`](#rplwhoisaccount-330) `(330)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISACTUALLY`](#rplwhoisactually-338) `(338)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISHOST`](#rplwhoishost-378) `(378)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISMODES`](#rplwhoismodes-379) `(379)`
-   [`RPL_WHOISSECURE`](#rplwhoissecure-671) `(671)`
-   [`RPL_AWAY`](#rplaway-301) `(301)`

Servers typically send some of these numerics only to the client itself and to servers operators, as they contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed to other users.

Server implementers wishing to send information not covered by these numerics may send other vendor-specific numerics, such that:

-   the first and second parameters MUST be the client’s nick, and the target nick, and
-   the last parameter SHOULD be designed to be human-readable, so that user interfaces can display unknown numerics

Additionally, server implementers should consider submitting these to [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net/) for standardization, if relevant.

#### <a href="#optional-extensions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optional extensions

This section describes extension to the common `WHOIS` command above. They exist mainly on historical servers, and are rarely implemented, because of resource usage they incur.

-   Servers MAY allow more than one target nick. They can advertise the maximum the number of target users per `WHOIS` command via the [`TARGMAX`](#targmax-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter, and silently drop targets if the number of targets exceeds the limit.

-   Servers MAY allow wildcards in `<nick>`. Servers who do SHOULD reply with information about all matching nicks. They may restrict what information is available in this case, to limit resource usage.

-   IRCv3 [`multi-prefix` Extension](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multi-prefix)

### <a href="#whowas-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHOWAS message

         Command: WHOWAS
      Parameters: <nick> [<count>]

Whowas asks for information about a nickname which no longer exists. This may either be due to a nickname change or the user leaving IRC. In response to this query, the server searches through its nickname history, looking for any nicks which are lexically the same (no wild card matching here). The history is searched backward, returning the most recent entry first. If there are multiple entries, up to `<count>` replies will be returned (or all of them if no `<count>` parameter is given).

If given, `<count>` SHOULD be a positive number. Otherwise, a full search is done.

Servers MUST reply with either [`ERR_WASNOSUCHNICK`](#errwasnosuchnick-406) `(406)` or a non-empty list of WHOWAS entries, both followed with [`RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS`](#rplendofwhowas-369) `(369)`

A WHOWAS entry is a series of numeric messages starting with [`RPL_WHOWASUSER`](#rplwhowasuser-314) `(314)`, optionally followed by other numerics relevant to that user, such as [`RPL_WHOISACTUALLY`](#rplwhoisactually-338) `(338)` and [`RPL_WHOISSERVER`](#rplwhoisserver-312) `(312)`. Clients MUST NOT assume any particular numeric other than [`RPL_WHOWASUSER`](#rplwhowasuser-314) `(314)` is present in a WHOWAS entry.

If the `<nick>` argument is missing, they SHOULD send a single reply, using either [`ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN`](#errnonicknamegiven-431) `(431)` or [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`.

## <a href="#operator-messages" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operator Messages

The following messages are typically reserved to server operators.

### <a href="#kill-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>KILL message

         Command: KILL
      Parameters: <nickname> <comment>

The `KILL` command is used to close the connection between a given client and the server they are connected to. `KILL` is a privileged command and is available only to IRC Operators. `<nickname>` represents the user to be ‘killed’, and `<comment>` is shown to all users and to the user themselves upon being killed.

When a `KILL` command is used, the client being killed receives the `KILL` message, and the `<source>` of the message SHOULD be the operator who performed the command. The user being killed and every user sharing a channel with them receives a [`QUIT`](#quit-message) message representing that they are leaving the network. The `<reason>` on this `QUIT` message typically has the form: `"Killed (<killer> (<reason>))"` where `<killer>` is the nickname of the user who performed the `KILL`. The user being killed then receives the [`ERROR`](#error-message) message, typically containing a `<reason>` of `"Closing Link: <servername> (Killed (<killer> (<reason>)))"`. After this, their connection is closed.

If a `KILL` message is received by a client, it means that the user specified by `<nickname>` is being killed. With certain servers, users may elect to receive `KILL` messages created for other users to keep an eye on the network. This behavior may also be restricted to operators.

Clients can rejoin instantly after this command is performed on them. However, it can serve as a warning to a user to stop their activity. As it breaks the flow of data from the user, it can also be used to stop large amounts of ‘flooding’ from abusive users or due to accidents. Abusive users may not care and promptly reconnect and resume their abusive behaviour. In these cases, opers may look at the [`KLINE`](#kline-message) command to keep them from rejoining the network for a longer time.

As nicknames across an IRC network MUST be unique, if duplicates are found when servers join, one or both of the clients MAY be `KILL`ed and removed from the network. Servers may also handle this case in alternate ways that don’t involve removing users from the network.

Servers MAY restrict whether specific operators can remove users on other servers (remote users). If the operator tries to remove a remote user but is not privileged to, they should receive the [`ERR_NOPRIVS`](#errnoprivs-723) `(723)` numeric.

`<comment>` SHOULD reflect why the `KILL` was performed. For user-generated `KILL`s, it is up to the user to provide an adequate reason.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NOSUCHSERVER`](#errnosuchserver-402) `(402)`
-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`](#errnoprivileges-481) `(481)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVS`](#errnoprivs-723) `(723)`

NOTE: The `KILL` message is weird, and I need to look at it more closely, add some examples, etc.

### <a href="#rehash-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>REHASH message

         Command: REHASH
      Parameters: None

The `REHASH` command is an administrative command which can be used by an operator to force the local server to re-read and process its configuration file. This may include other data, such as modules or TLS certificates.

Servers MAY accept, as an optional argument, the name of a remote server that should be rehashed instead of the current one.

Numeric replies:

-   [`RPL_REHASHING`](#rplrehashing-382) `(382)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`](#errnoprivileges-481) `(481)`

Example:

     REHASH                          ; message from user with operator
                                     status to server asking it to reread
                                     its configuration file.

### <a href="#restart-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RESTART message

         Command: RESTART
      Parameters: None

An operator can use the restart command to force the server to restart itself. This message is optional since it may be viewed as a risk to allow arbitrary people to connect to a server as an operator and execute this command, causing (at least) a disruption to service.

Numeric replies:

-   [`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`](#errnoprivileges-481) `(481)`

Example:

     RESTART                         ; no parameters required.

### <a href="#squit-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SQUIT message

         Command: SQUIT
      Parameters: <server> <comment>

The `SQUIT` command disconnects a server from the network. `SQUIT` is a privileged command and is only available to IRC Operators. `<comment>` is the reason why the server link is being disconnected.

In a traditional spanning-tree topology, the command gets forwarded to the specified server. And the link between the specified server and the last server to propagate the command gets broken.

Numeric replies:

-   [`ERR_NOSUCHSERVER`](#errnosuchserver-402) `(402)`
-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`](#errnoprivileges-481) `(481)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVS`](#errnoprivs-723) `(723)`

Examples:

     SQUIT tolsun.oulu.fi :Bad Link ?  ; Command to uplink of the server
                                     tolson.oulu.fi to terminate its
                                     connection with comment "Bad Link".

## <a href="#optional-messages" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optional Messages

These messages are not required for a server implementation to work, but SHOULD be implemented. If a command is not implemented, it MUST return the [`ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND`](#errunknowncommand-421) `(421)` numeric.

### <a href="#away-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AWAY message

         Command: AWAY
      Parameters: [<text>]

The `AWAY` command lets clients indicate that their user is away. If this command is sent with a nonempty parameter (the ‘away message’) then the user is set to be away. If this command is sent with no parameters, or with the empty string as the parameter, the user is no longer away.

The server acknowledges the change in away status by returning the [`RPL_NOWAWAY`](#rplnowaway-306) `(306)` and [`RPL_UNAWAY`](#rplunaway-305) `(305)` numerics. If the [IRCv3 `away-notify` capability](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/away-notify.html) has been requested by a client, the server MAY also send that client `AWAY` messages to tell them how the away status of other users has changed.

Servers SHOULD notify clients when a user they’re interacting with is away when relevant, including sending these numerics:

1.  [`RPL_AWAY`](#rplaway-301) `(301)`, with the away message, when a [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) command is directed at the away user (not to a channel they are on).
2.  [`RPL_AWAY`](#rplaway-301) `(301)`, with the away message, in replies to [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) messages.
3.  In the [`RPL_USERHOST`](#rpluserhost-302) `(302)` numeric, as the `+` or `-` character.
4.  In the [`RPL_WHOREPLY`](#rplwhoreply-352) `(352)` numeric, as the `H` or `G` character.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`RPL_UNAWAY`](#rplunaway-305) `(305)`
-   [`RPL_NOWAWAY`](#rplnowaway-306) `(306)`

### <a href="#links-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LINKS message

         Command: LINKS
      Parameters: None

With LINKS, a user can list all servers which are known by the server answering the query, usually including the server itself.

In replying to the LINKS message, a server MUST send replies back using zero or more [`RPL_LINKS`](#rpllinks-364) `(364)` messages and mark the end of the list using a [`RPL_ENDOFLINKS`](#rplendoflinks-365) `(365)` message.

Servers MAY omit some or all servers on the network, including itself.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`RPL_LINKS`](#rpllinks-364) `(364)`
-   [`RPL_ENDOFLINKS`](#rplendoflinks-365) `(365)`

### <a href="#userhost-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>USERHOST message

         Command: USERHOST
      Parameters: <nickname>{ <nickname>}

The `USERHOST` command is used to return information about users with the given nicknames. The `USERHOST` command takes up to five nicknames, each a separate parameters. The nicknames are returned in [`RPL_USERHOST`](#rpluserhost-302) `(302)` numerics.

Numeric Replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`RPL_USERHOST`](#rpluserhost-302) `(302)`

Command Examples:

      USERHOST Wiz Michael Marty p    ;USERHOST request for information on
                                      nicks "Wiz", "Michael", "Marty" and "p"

Reply Examples:

      :ircd.stealth.net 302 yournick :syrk=+syrk@millennium.stealth.net
                                      ; Reply for user syrk

### <a href="#wallops-message" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WALLOPS message

         Command: WALLOPS
      Parameters: <text>

The WALLOPS command is used to send a message to all currently connected users who have set the ‘w’ user mode for themselves. The `<text>` SHOULD be non-empty.

Servers MAY echo WALLOPS messages to their sender even if they don’t have the ‘w’ user mode.

Servers MAY send WALLOPS only to operators.

Servers may generate it themselves, and MAY allow operators to send them.

Numeric replies:

-   [`ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS`](#errneedmoreparams-461) `(461)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`](#errnoprivileges-481) `(481)`
-   [`ERR_NOPRIVS`](#errnoprivs-723) `(723)`

Examples:

     :csd.bu.edu WALLOPS :Connect '*.uiuc.edu 6667' from Joshua
                                     ;WALLOPS message from csd.bu.edu announcing
                                     a CONNECT message it received and acted
                                     upon from Joshua.

# <a href="#channel-types" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel Types

IRC has various types of channels that act in different ways. What differentiates these channels is the character the channel name starts with. For instance, channels starting with `#` are regular channels, and channels starting with `&` are local channels.

Upon joining, clients are shown which types of channels the server supports with the [`CHANTYPES`](#chantypes-parameter) parameter.

Here, we go through the different types of channels that exist and are widely-used these days.

### <a href="#regular-channels-" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Regular Channels (`#`)

The prefix character for this type of channel is `('#', 0x23)`.

This channel is what’s referred to as a normal channel. Clients can join this channel, and the first client who joins a normal channel is made a [channel operator](#channel-operators), along with the appropriate channel membership prefix. On most servers, newly-created channels have then [protected topic `"+t"`](#protected-topic-mode) and [no external messages `"+n"`](#no-external-messages-mode) modes enabled, but exactly what modes new channels are given is up to the server.

Regular channels are persisted across the network. If two clients on different servers join the same regular channel, they’ll be able to see that each other are joined, and will see messages sent to the channel by the other client.

On servers that support the concept of ‘channel ownership’ (a client being able to own a channel and retain control of it with their account), clients may not receive channel operator priveledges on joining an otherwise empty channel.

### <a href="#local-channels-" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Local Channels (`&`)

The prefix character for this type of channel is `('&', 0x26)`.

This channel is what’s referred to as a local channel. Clients can join this channel as normal, and the first client who joins a normal channel is made a [channel operator](#channel-operators), but the channel is not persisted across the network. In other words, each server has its own set of local channels that the other servers on the network don’t see.

If a client on server A and a client on server B join the channel `&info`, they will not be able to see each other or the messages each posts to their server’s local channel `&info`. However, if a client on server A and another client on server A join the channel `&info`, they will be able to see each other and the messages the other posts to that local channel.

Generally, the concept of channel ownership is not supported for local channels. Local channels also aren’t as widely available as regular channels. As well, some networks disable or disallow local channels as opers across the network can neither see nor administrate them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#modes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modes

Modes affect the behaviour and reflect details about targets – clients and channels. The modes listed here are the ones that have been adopted and are used by the IRC community at large. If we say a mode is ‘standard’, that means it is defined in the official IRC specification documents.

The status and letter used for each mode is defined in the description of that mode.

We only cover modes that are widely-used by IRC software today and whose meanings should stay consistent between different server software. For more extensive lists (including conflicting and obsolete modes), see the external `irc-defs` [client](https://defs.ircdocs.horse/defs/usermodes.html) and [channel](https://defs.ircdocs.horse/defs/chanmodes.html) mode lists.

## <a href="#user-modes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User Modes

### <a href="#invisible-user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Invisible User Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+i"`.

If a user is set to ‘invisible’, they will not show up in commands such as [`WHO`](#who-message) or [`NAMES`](#names-message) unless they share a channel with the user that submitted the command. In addition, some servers hide all channels from the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) reply of an invisible user they do not share with the user that submitted the command.

### <a href="#oper-user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Oper User Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for is it `"+o"`.

If a user has this mode, this indicates that they are a network [operator](#operators).

### <a href="#local-oper-user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Local Oper User Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+O"`.

If a user has this mode, this indicates that they are a server [operator](#operators). A local operator has [operator](#operators) privileges for their server, and not for the rest of the network.

### <a href="#registered-user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Registered User Mode

This mode is widely-used, and the mode letter used for it is typically `"+r"`. The character used for this mode, and whether it exists at all, may vary depending on server software and configuration.

If a user has this mode, this indicates that they have logged into a user account.

IRCv3 extensions such as [`account-notify`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-notify-3.1.html), [`account-tag`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-tag-3.2.html), and [`extended-join`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/extended-join-3.1.html) provide the account name of logged-in users, and are more accurate than trying to detect this user mode due to the capability name remaining consistent.

### <a href="#wallops-user-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`WALLOPS` User Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+w"`.

If a user has this mode, this indicates that they will receive [`WALLOPS`](#wallops-message) messages from the server.

## <a href="#channel-modes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel Modes

### <a href="#ban-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ban Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+b"`.

This channel mode controls a list of client masks that are ‘banned’ from joining or speaking in the channel. If this mode has values, each of these values should be a client mask.

If this mode is set on a channel, and a client sends a `JOIN` request for this channel, their nickmask (the combination of `nick!user@host`) is compared with each banned client mask set with this mode. If they match one of these banned masks, they will receive an [`ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN`](#errbannedfromchan-474) `(474)` reply and the `JOIN` command will fail. See the [ban exception](#ban-exception-channel-mode) mode for more details.

### <a href="#exception-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exception Channel Mode

This mode is used in almost all IRC software today. The standard mode letter used for it is `"+e"`, but it SHOULD be defined in the [`EXCEPTS`](#excepts-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter on connection.

This channel mode controls a list of client masks that are exempt from the [‘ban’](#ban-channel-mode) channel mode. If this mode has values, each of these values should be a client mask.

If this mode is set on a channel, and a client sends a `JOIN` request for this channel, their nickmask is compared with each ‘exempted’ client mask. If their nickmask matches any one of the masks set by this mode, and their nickmask also matches any one of the masks set by the [ban](#ban-channel-mode) channel mode, they will not be blocked from joining due to the [ban](#ban-channel-mode) mode.

### <a href="#client-limit-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Client Limit Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+l"`.

This channel mode controls whether new users may join based on the number of users who already exist in the channel. If this mode is set, its value is an integer and defines the limit of how many clients may be joined to the channel.

If this mode is set on a channel, and the number of users joined to that channel matches or exceeds the value of this mode, new users cannot join that channel. If a client sends a `JOIN` request for this channel, they will receive an [`ERR_CHANNELISFULL`](#errchannelisfull-471) `(471)` reply and the command will fail.

### <a href="#invite-only-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Invite-Only Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+i"`.

This channel mode controls whether new users need to be invited to the channel before being able to join.

If this mode is set on a channel, a user must have received an [`INVITE`](#invite-message) for this channel before being allowed to join it. If they have not received an invite, they will receive an [`ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN`](#errinviteonlychan-473) `(473)` reply and the command will fail.

### <a href="#invite-exception-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Invite-Exception Channel Mode

This mode is used in almost all IRC software today. The standard mode letter used for it is `"+I"`, but it SHOULD be defined in the [`INVEX`](#invex-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter on connection.

This channel mode controls a list of channel masks that are exempt from the [invite-only](#invite-only-channel-mode) channel mode. If this mode has values, each of these values should be a client mask.

If this mode is set on a channel, and a client sends a `JOIN` request for that channel, their nickmask is compared with each ‘exempted’ client mask. If their nickmask matches any one of the masks set by this mode, and the channel is in [invite-only](#invite-only-channel-mode) mode, they do not need to require an `INVITE` in order to join the channel.

### <a href="#key-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+k"`.

This mode letter sets a ‘key’ that must be supplied in order to join this channel. If this mode is set, its’ value is the key that is required. Servers may validate the value (eg. to forbid spaces, as they make it harder to use the key in `JOIN` messages). If the value is invalid, they SHOULD return [`ERR_INVALIDMODEPARAM`](#errinvalidmodeparam-696). However, clients MUST be able to handle any of the following:

-   [`ERR_INVALIDMODEPARAM`](#errinvalidmodeparam-696)
-   [`ERR_INVALIDKEY`](#errinvalidkey-525)
-   `MODE` echoed with a different key (eg. truncated or stripped of invalid characters)
-   the key changed ignored, and no `MODE` echoed if no other mode change was valid.

If this mode is set on a channel, and a client sends a `JOIN` request for that channel, they must supply `<key>` in order for the command to succeed. If they do not supply a `<key>`, or the key they supply does not match the value of this mode, they will receive an [`ERR_BADCHANNELKEY`](#errbadchannelkey-475) `(475)` reply and the command will fail.

### <a href="#moderated-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moderated Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+m"`.

This channel mode controls whether users may freely talk on the channel, and does not have any value.

If this mode is set on a channel, only users who have channel privileges may send messages to that channel. The [voice](#voice-prefix) channel mode is designed to let a user talk in a moderated channel without giving them other channel moderation abilities, and users of higher privileges (such as [halfops](#halfop-prefix) or [chanops](#operator-prefix)) may also speak in moderated channels.

### <a href="#secret-channel-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Secret Channel Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+s"`.

This channel mode controls whether the channel is ‘secret’, and does not have any value.

A channel that is set to secret will not show up in responses to the [`LIST`](#list-message) or [`NAMES`](#names-message) command unless the client sending the command is joined to the channel. Likewise, secret channels will not show up in the [`RPL_WHOISCHANNELS`](#rplwhoischannels-319) `(319)` numeric unless the user the numeric is being sent to is joined to that channel.

### <a href="#protected-topic-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Protected Topic Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+t"`.

This channel mode controls whether channel privileges are required to set the topic, and does not have any value.

If this mode is enabled, users must have channel privileges such as [halfop](#halfop-prefix) or [operator](#operator-prefix) status in order to change the topic of a channel. In a channel that does not have this mode enabled, anyone may set the topic of the channel using the [`TOPIC`](#topic-message) command.

### <a href="#no-external-messages-mode" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No External Messages Mode

This mode is standard, and the mode letter used for it is `"+n"`.

This channel mode controls whether users who are not joined to the channel can send messages to it, and does not have any value.

If this mode is enabled, users MUST be joined to the channel in order to send [private messages](#privmsg-message) and [notices](#notice-message) to the channel. If this mode is enabled and they try to send one of these to a channel they are not joined to, they will receive an [`ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN`](#errcannotsendtochan-404) `(404)` numeric and the message will not be sent to that channel.

## <a href="#channel-membership-prefixes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Channel Membership Prefixes

Users joined to a channel may get certain privileges or status in that channel based on channel modes given to them. These users are given prefixes before their nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (ie, in [`NAMES`](#names-message), [`WHO`](#who-message) and [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) messages). The standard and common prefixes are listed here, and MUST be advertised by the server in the [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter on connection.

### <a href="#founder-prefix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Founder Prefix

This mode is used in a large number of networks. The prefix and mode letter typically used for it, respectively, are `"~"` and `"+q"`.

This prefix shows that the given user is the ‘founder’ of the current channel and has full moderation control over it – ie, they are considered to ‘own’ that channel by the network. This prefix is typically only used on networks that have the concept of client accounts, and ownership of channels by those accounts.

### <a href="#protected-prefix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Protected Prefix

This mode is used in a large number of networks. The prefix and mode letter typically used for it, respectively, are `"&"` and `"+a"`.

Users with this mode cannot be kicked and cannot have this mode removed by other protected users. In some software, they may perform actions that operators can, but at a higher privilege level than operators. This prefix is typically only used on networks that have the concept of client accounts, and ownership of channels by those accounts.

### <a href="#operator-prefix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operator Prefix

This mode is standard. The prefix and mode letter used for it, respectively, are `"@"` and `"+o"`.

Users with this mode may perform channel moderation tasks such as kicking users, applying channel modes, and set other users to operator (or lower) status.

### <a href="#halfop-prefix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Halfop Prefix

This mode is widely used in networks today. The prefix and mode letter used for it, respectively, are `"%"` and `"+h"`.

Users with this mode may perform channel moderation tasks, but at a lower privilege level than operators. Which channel moderation tasks they can and cannot perform varies with server software and configuration.

### <a href="#voice-prefix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Voice Prefix

This mode is standard. The prefix and mode letter used for it, respectively, are `"+"` and `"+v"`.

Users with this mode may send messages to a channel that is [moderated](#moderated-channel-mode).

# <a href="#numerics" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Numerics

As mentioned in the [numeric replies](#numeric-replies) section, the first parameter of most numerics is the target of that numeric (the nickname of the client that is receiving it). Underneath the name and numeric of each reply, we list the parameters sent by this message.

Clients MUST NOT fail because the number of parameters on a given incoming numeric is larger than the number of parameters we list for that numeric here. Most IRC servers extends some of these numerics with their own special additions. For example, if a message is listed here as having 2 parameters, and your client receives it with 5 parameters, your client should not fail to parse or handle that message correctly because of the extra parameters.

Optional parameters are surrounded with the standard square brackets `([<optional>])` – this means clients MUST NOT assume they will receive this parameter from all servers, and that servers SHOULD send this parameter unless otherwise specified in the numeric description. Parameters and parts of parameters surrounded with curly brackets `({ <repeating>})` may be repeated zero or more times.

Server authors that wish to extend one of the numerics listed here SHOULD make their extension into a [client capability](#capability-negotiation). If your extension would be useful to other client and server software, you should consider submitting it to the [IRCv3 Working Group](http://ircv3.net/) for standardisation.

Note that for numerics with “human-readable” informational strings for the last parameter which are not designed to be parsed, such as in `RPL_WELCOME`, servers commonly change this last-param text. Clients SHOULD NOT rely on these sort of parameters to have exactly the same human-readable string as described in this document. Clients that rely on the format of these human-readable final informational strings may fail. We do try to note numerics where this is the case with a message like *“The text used in the last param of this message varies wildly”*.

### <a href="#rplwelcome-001" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WELCOME (001)`

      "<client> :Welcome to the <networkname> Network, <nick>[!<user>@<host>]"

The first message sent after client registration, this message introduces the client to the network. The text used in the last param of this message varies wildly.

Servers that implement spoofed hostmasks in any capacity SHOULD NOT include the extended (complete) hostmask in the last parameter of this reply, either for all clients or for those whose hostnames have been spoofed. This is because some clients try to extract the hostname from this final parameter of this message and resolve this hostname, in order to discover their ‘local IP address’.

Clients MUST NOT try to extract the hostname from the final parameter of this message and then attempt to resolve this hostname. This method of operation WILL BREAK and will cause issues when the server returns a spoofed hostname.

### <a href="#rplyourhost-002" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_YOURHOST (002)`

      "<client> :Your host is <servername>, running version <version>"

Part of the post-registration greeting, this numeric returns the name and software/version of the server the client is currently connected to. The text used in the last param of this message varies wildly.

### <a href="#rplcreated-003" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_CREATED (003)`

      "<client> :This server was created <datetime>"

Part of the post-registration greeting, this numeric returns a human-readable date/time that the server was started or created. The text used in the last param of this message varies wildly.

### <a href="#rplmyinfo-004" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_MYINFO (004)`

      "<client> <servername> <version> <available user modes>
      <available channel modes> [<channel modes with a parameter>]"

Part of the post-registration greeting. Clients SHOULD discover available features using `RPL_ISUPPORT` tokens rather than the mode letters listed in this reply.

### <a href="#rplisupport-005" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_ISUPPORT (005)`

      "<client> <1-13 tokens> :are supported by this server"

The ABNF representation for an `RPL_ISUPPORT` token is:

      token      =  *1"-" parameter / parameter *1( "=" value )
      parameter  =  1*20 letter
      value      =  * letpun
      letter     =  ALPHA / DIGIT
      punct      =  %d33-47 / %d58-64 / %d91-96 / %d123-126
      letpun     =  letter / punct

As the maximum number of message parameters to any reply is 15, the maximum number of `RPL_ISUPPORT` tokens that can be advertised is 13. To counter this, a server MAY issue multiple `RPL_ISUPPORT` numerics. A server MUST issue at least one `RPL_ISUPPORT` numeric after client registration has completed. It MUST be issued before further commands from the client are processed.

When clients send a [`VERSION`](#version-message) command to an external server (i.e. not the one they’re currently connected to), they receive the appropriate information from that server. That external server’s `ISUPPORT` tokens are sent to the client using the `105` (`RPL_REMOTEISUPPORT`) numeric instead of `005`, to ensure that clients don’t process and start using these tokens sent by an external server. The format of the `105` message is exactly the same as `RPL_ISUPPORT` – the numeric itself is the only difference.

A token is of the form `PARAMETER`, `PARAMETER=VALUE` or `-PARAMETER`. Servers MUST send the parameter as upper-case text.

Tokens of the form `PARAMETER` or `PARAMETER=VALUE` are used to advertise features or information to clients. A parameter MAY have a default value and value MAY be empty when sent by servers. Unless otherwise stated, when a parameter contains a value, the value MUST be treated as being case sensitive. The value MAY contain multiple fields, if this is the case the fields SHOULD be delimited with a comma character `(",", 0x2C)`. The value MAY contain escape sequences: `\x20` for the space character `(" ", 0x20)`, `\x5C` for the backslash character `("\", 0x5C)` and `\x3D` for the equal character `("=", 0x3D)`.

If the value of a parameter changes, the server SHOULD re-advertise the parameter with the new value in an `RPL_ISUPPORT` reply. An example of this is a client becoming an [IRC operator](#oper-message) and their [`CHANLIMIT`](#chanlimit-parameter) changing.

Tokens of the form `-PARAMETER` are used to negate a previously specified parameter. If the client receives a token like this, the client MUST consider that parameter to be removed and revert to the behaviour that would occur if the parameter was not specified. The client MUST act as though the paramater is no longer advertised to it. These tokens are intended to allow servers to change their features without disconnecting clients. Tokens of this form MUST NOT contain a value field.

The server MAY negate parameters which have not been previously advertised; in this case, the client MUST ignore the token.

A single `RPL_ISUPPORT` reply MUST NOT contain the same parameter multiple times nor advertise and negate the same parameter. However, the server is free to advertise or negate the same parameter in separate replies.

See the [Feature Advertisement](#feature-advertisement) section for more details on this numeric. A list of parameters is available in the [`RPL_ISUPPORT` Parameters](#rplisupport-parameters) section.

### <a href="#rplbounce-010" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_BOUNCE (010)`

      "<client> <hostname> <port> :<info>"

Sent to the client to redirect it to another server. The `<info>` text varies between server software and reasons for the redirection.

Because this numeric does not specify whether to enable SSL and is not interpreted correctly by all clients, it is recommended that this not be used.

This numeric is also known as `RPL_REDIR` by some software.

### <a href="#rplstatscommands-212" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_STATSCOMMANDS (212)`

      "<client> <command> :Please wait a while and try again."

When a server drops a command without processing it, this numeric MUST be sent to inform the client. The text used in the last param of this message varies wildly, and commonly provides the client with more information about why the command could not be processed (i.e., due to rate-limiting).

### <a href="#rpllocalusers-265" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_LOCALUSERS (265)`

      "<client> [<u> <m>] :Current local users <u>, max <m>"

Sent as a reply to the [`LUSERS`](#lusers-message) command. `<u>` and `<m>` are non-negative integers and represent the number of clients currently and the maximum number of clients that have been connected directly to this server at one time, respectively.

The ABNF representation for `<reply>` is:

      reply   =  nickname [ isop ] "=" isaway hostname
      isop    =  "*"
      isaway  =  ( "+" / "-" )

`<isop>` is included if the user with the nickname of `<nickname>` has registered as an [operator](#operators). `<isaway>` represents whether that user has set an \[away\] message. `"+"` represents that the user is not away, and `"-"` represents that the user is away.

### <a href="#rplunaway-305" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_UNAWAY (305)`

      "<client> :You are no longer marked as being away"

Sent as a reply to the [`AWAY`](#away-message) command, this lets the client know that they are no longer set as being away. The text used in the last param of this message may vary.

      "<client> <nick> :has identified for this nick"

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric indicates that the client with the nickname `<nick>` was authenticated as the owner of this nick on the network.

See also [`RPL_WHOISACCOUNT`](#rplwhoisaccount-330), for information on the account name of the user.

### <a href="#rplwhoisuser-311" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WHOISUSER (311)`

      "<client> <nick> <username> <host> * :<realname>"

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric shows details about the client with the nickname `<nick>`. `<username>` and `<realname>` represent the names set by the [`USER`](#user-message) command (though `<username>` may be set by the server in other ways). `<host>` represents the host used for the client in nickmasks (which may or may not be a real hostname or IP address). `<host>` CANNOT start with a colon `(':', 0x3A)` as this would get parsed as a trailing parameter – IPv6 addresses such as `"::1"` are prefixed with a zero `('0', 0x30)` to ensure this.

### <a href="#rplwhoisoperator-313" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WHOISOPERATOR (313)`

      "<client> <nick> :is an IRC operator"

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric indicates that the client with the nickname `<nick>` is an [operator](#operators). This command MAY also indicate what type or level of operator the client is by changing the text in the last parameter of this numeric.

### <a href="#rplwhoisidle-317" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WHOISIDLE (317)`

      "<client> <nick> <secs> <signon> :seconds idle, signon time"

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric indicates how long the client with the nickname `<nick>` has been idle. `<secs>` is the number of seconds since the client has been active. Servers generally denote specific commands (for instance, perhaps [`JOIN`](#join-message), [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message), [`NOTICE`](#notice-message), etc) as updating the ‘idle time’, and calculate this off when the idle time was last updated. `<signon>` is a unix timestamp representing when the user joined the network.

This numeric is sent after all other `WHOIS` response numerics have been sent to the client.

### <a href="#rplwhoischannels-319" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WHOISCHANNELS (319)`

      "<client> <nick> :[prefix]<channel>{ [prefix]<channel>}

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric lists the channels that the client with the nickname `<nick>` is joined to and their status in these channels. `<prefix>` is the highest [channel membership prefix](#channel-membership-prefixes) that the client has in that channel, if the client has one. `<channel>` is the name of a channel that the client is joined to. The last parameter of this numeric is a list of `[prefix]<channel>` pairs, delimited by a SPACE character `(' ', 0x20)`. Clients MUST ignore the trailing SPACE character, if any.

`RPL_WHOISCHANNELS` can be sent multiple times in the same whois reply, if the target is on too many channels to fit in a single message.

The channels in this response are affected by the [secret](#secret-channel-mode) channel mode and the [invisible](#invisible-user-mode) user mode, and may be affected by other modes depending on server software and configuration.

### <a href="#rplwhoisspecial-320" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_WHOISSPECIAL (320)`

      "<client> <nick> :blah blah blah"

      "<client> Channel :Users  Name"

Sent as a reply to the [`LIST`](#list-message) command, this numeric marks the start of a channel list. As noted in the command description, this numeric MAY be skipped by the server so clients MUST NOT depend on receiving it.

### <a href="#rpllist-322" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_LIST (322)`

      "<client> <channel> <client count> :<topic>"

Sent as a reply to the [`WHOIS`](#whois-message) command, this numeric indicates that the client with the nickname `<nick>` was authenticated as the owner of `<account>`.

This does not necessarily mean the user owns their current nickname, which is covered by[`RPL_WHOISREGNICK`](#rplwhoisregnick-307).

### <a href="#rplnotopic-331" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_NOTOPIC (331)`

      "<client> <channel>"

Sent to a client as a reply to the [`INVITE`](#invite-message) command when used with no parameter, to indicate a channel the client was invited to.

This numeric should not be confused with [`RPL_INVEXLIST`](#rplinvexlist-346) `(346)`, which is used as a reply to [`MODE`](#mode-message).

Some rare implementations use 346 instead of 336 for this reply.

### <a href="#rplendofinvitelist-337" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST (337)`

      "<client> :End of /INVITE list"

Sent as a reply to the [`INVITE`](#invite-message) command when used with no parameter, this numeric indicates the end of invitations a client received.

`<username>` represents the name set by the [`USER`](#user-message) command (though `<username>` may be set by the server in other ways).

`<host>` and `<ip>` represent the real host and IP address the client is connecting from. `<host>` CANNOT start with a colon `(':', 0x3A)` as this would get parsed as a trailing parameter – IPv6 addresses such as `"::1"` are prefixed with a zero `('0', 0x30)` to ensure this. The resulting IPv6 is equivalent, as this is a partial expansion of the `::` shorthand.

See also: [`RPL_WHOISHOST`](#rplwhoishost-378) `(378)`, for similar semantics on other servers.

### <a href="#rplinviting-341" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_INVITING (341)`

If the [`WHO`](#who-message) command was given a channel as the `<mask>` parameter, then the same channel MUST be returned in `<channel>`. Otherwise `<channel>` is an arbitrary channel the client is joined to or a literal asterisk character `('*', 0x2A)` if no channel is returned. `<hopcount>` is the number of intermediate servers between the client issuing the `WHO` command and the client `<nick>`, it might be unreliable so clients SHOULD ignore it.

`<flags>` contains the following characters, in this order:

-   Away status: the letter H `('H', 0x48)` to indicate that the user is here, or the letter G `('G', 0x47)` to indicate that the user is gone.
-   Optionally, a literal asterisk character `('*', 0x2A)` to indicate that the user is a server operator.
-   Optionally, the highest [channel membership prefix](#channel-membership-prefixes) that the client has in `<channel>`, if the client has one.
-   Optionally, one or more user mode characters and other arbitrary server-specific flags.

# <a href="#rplisupport-parameters" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`RPL_ISUPPORT` Parameters

Used to [advertise features](#feature-advertisement) to clients, the [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#rplisupport-005) `(005)` numeric lists parameters that let the client know which features are active and their value, if any.

The parameters listed here are standardised and/or widely-advertised by IRC servers today and do not include deprecated parameters. Servers SHOULD support at least the following parameters where appropriate, and may advertise any others. For a more extensive list of parameters advertised by this numeric, see the `irc-defs` [`RPL_ISUPPORT` list](https://defs.ircdocs.horse/defs/isupport.html).

Certain parameters described here may not be standardised nor widely-advertised. These parameters are noted with the descriptor `"Status: Proposed"`. However, we try to be conservative with the parameters we’re proposing, both in terms of having a small number of them and them being fairly understandable extensions to the current widely-used parameters.

If a ‘default value’ is listed for a parameter, this is the assumed value of the parameter until and unless it is advertised by the server. This is primarily to interoperate with servers that don’t advertise particular well-known and well-used parameters. If an ‘empty value’ is listed for a parameter, this is the assumed value of the parameter if it is advertised without a value.

### <a href="#awaylen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`AWAYLEN` Parameter

      Format: AWAYLEN=<number>

The `AWAYLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length for the `<reason>` of an [`AWAY`](#away-message) command. If an [`AWAY`](#away-message) `<reason>` has more characters than this parameter, it may be silently truncated by the server before being passed on to other clients. Clients MAY receive an [`AWAY`](#away-message) `<reason>` that has more characters than this parameter.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      AWAYLEN=200

      AWAYLEN=307

### <a href="#casemapping-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`CASEMAPPING` Parameter

      Format: CASEMAPPING=<casemap>

The `CASEMAPPING` parameter indicates what method the server uses to compare equality of case-insensitive strings (such as channel names and nicks).

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a string representing the method that the server uses.

The specified casemappings are as follows:

-   **`ascii`**: Defines the characters `a` to `z` to be considered the lower-case equivalents of the characters `A` to `Z` only.
-   **`rfc1459`**: Same as `'ascii'`, with the addition of the characters `'{'`, `'}'`, `'|'`, and `'^'` being considered the lower-case equivalents of the characters `'['`, `']'`, `'\'`, and `'~'` respectively.
-   **`rfc1459-strict`**: Same casemapping as `'ascii'`, with the characters `'{'`, `'}'`, and `'|'` being the lower-case equivalents of `'['`, `']'`, and `'\'`, respectively. Note that the difference between this and `rfc1459` above is that in rfc1459-strict, `'^'` and `'~'` are not casefolded.
-   **`rfc7613`**: Proposed casemapping which defines a method based on PRECIS, allowing additional Unicode characters to be correctly casemapped <sup>[\[link\]](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/272)</sup>.

The value MUST be specified and is a string. Servers MAY advertise alternate casemappings to those above, but clients MAY NOT be able to understand or perform them. If the parameter is not published by the server at all, clients SHOULD assume `CASEMAPPING=rfc1459`.

Servers SHOULD AVOID using the `rfc1459` casemapping unless explicitly required for compatibility reasons or for linking with servers using it. The equivalency of the extra characters is not necessary nor useful today, and issues such as incorrect implementations and a conflict between matching masks exists.

Examples:

      CASEMAPPING=ascii

      CASEMAPPING=rfc1459

### <a href="#chanlimit-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`CHANLIMIT` Parameter

      Format: CHANLIMIT=<prefixes>:[limit]{,<prefixes>:[limit]}

The `CHANLIMIT` parameter indicates the number of channels a client may join.

The value MUST be specified and is a list of `"<prefixes>:<limit>"` pairs, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. `<prefixes>` is a list of channel prefix characters as defined in the [`CHANTYPES`](#chantypes-parameter) parameter. `<limit>` is OPTIONAL and if specified is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of these types of channels a client may join. If there is no limit to the number of these channels a client may join, `<limit>` will not be specified.

Clients should not assume other clients are limited to what is specified in the `CHANLIMIT` parameter.

Examples:

      CHANLIMIT=#:25           ; indicates that clients may join 25 '#' channels

      CHANLIMIT=#&:50          ; indicates that clients may join 50 '#' and 50 '&' channels

      CHANLIMIT=#:70,&:        ; indicates that clients may join 70 '#' channels and any
                               number of '&' channels

### <a href="#chanmodes-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`CHANMODES` Parameter

      Format: CHANMODES=A,B,C,D[,X,Y...]

The `CHANMODES` parameter specifies the channel modes available and which types of arguments they do or do not take when using them with the [`MODE`](#mode-message) command.

The value lists the channel mode letters of **Type A**, **B**, **C**, and **D**, respectively, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. The channel mode types are defined in the the [`MODE`](#mode-message) message description.

To allow for future extensions, a server MAY send additional types, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. However, server authors SHOULD NOT extend this parameter without good reason, and SHOULD CONSIDER whether their mode would work as one of the existing types instead. The behaviour of any additional types is undefined.

Server MUST NOT list modes in this parameter that are also advertised in the [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) parameter. However, modes within the [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) parameter may be treated as type B modes.

Examples:

      CHANMODES=b,k,l,imnpst

      CHANMODES=beI,k,l,BCMNORScimnpstz

      CHANMODES=beI,kfL,lj,psmntirRcOAQKVCuzNSMTGZ

### <a href="#channellen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`CHANNELLEN` Parameter

      Format: CHANNELLEN=<string>

The `CHANNELLEN` parameter specifies the maximum length of a channel name that a client may join. A client elsewhere on the network MAY join a channel with a larger name, but network administrators should take care to ensure this value stays consistent across the network.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      CHANNELLEN=32

      CHANNELLEN=50

      CHANNELLEN=64

### <a href="#chantypes-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`CHANTYPES` Parameter

       Format: CHANTYPES=[string]
      Default: CHANTYPES=#

The `CHANTYPES` parameter indicates the channel prefix characters that are available on the current server. Common channel types are listed in the [Channel Types](#channel-types) section.

The value is OPTIONAL; if it is not present, it indicates that no channel types are supported. If the parameter is not published by the server at all, clients SHOULD assume `CHANTYPES=#&`, corresponding to the RFC1459 behavior.

Examples:

      CHANTYPES=#

      CHANTYPES=&#

      CHANTYPES=#&

### <a href="#elist-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`ELIST` Parameter

      Format: ELIST=<string>

The `ELIST` parameter indicates that the server supports search extensions to the [`LIST`](#list-message) command.

The value MUST be specified, and is a non-delimited list of letters, each of which denote an extension. The letters MUST be treated as being case-insensitive.

The following search extensions are defined:

-   **C**: Searching based on channel creation time, via the `"C<val"` and `"C>val"` modifiers to search for a channel that was created either less than `val` minutes ago, or more than `val` minutes ago, respectively
-   **M**: Searching based on a mask.
-   **N**: Searching based on a non-matching !mask. i.e., the opposite of `M`.
-   **T**: Searching based on topic set time, via the `"T<val"` and `"T>val"` modifiers to search for a topic time that was set less than `val` minutes ago, or more than `val` minutes ago, respectively.
-   **U**: Searching based on user count within the channel, via the `"<val"` and `">val"` modifiers to search for a channel that has less or more than `val` users, respectively.

Examples:

      ELIST=MNUCT

      ELIST=MU

      ELIST=CMNTU

A widespread bug in existing implementations is to swap the semantics of `"C<val"` with `"C>val"`, and/or `"T<val"` with `"T>val"`, due to ambiguous legacy specifications. You should check the server you are using implements them as expected.

### <a href="#excepts-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`EXCEPTS` Parameter

      Format: EXCEPTS=[character]
       Empty: e

The `EXCEPTS` parameter indicates that the server supports ban exceptions, as specified in the [ban exception](#ban-exception-channel-mode) channel mode section.

The value is OPTIONAL and when not specified indicates that the letter `"e"` is used as the channel mode for ban exceptions. If the value is specified, the character indicates the letter which is used for ban exceptions.

Examples:

      EXCEPTS

      EXCEPTS=e

### <a href="#extban-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`EXTBAN` Parameter

      Format: EXTBAN=[<prefix>],<types>

The `EXTBAN` parameter indicates the types of “extended ban masks” that the server supports.

`<prefix>` denotes the character that indicates an extban to the server and `<types>` is a list of characters indicating the types of extended bans the server supports. If `<prefix>` does not exist then the server does not require a prefix for extbans, and they should be sent with no prefix.

Extbans may allow clients to issue bans based on account name, SSL certificate fingerprints and other attributes, based on what the server supports.

Extban masks SHOULD also be supported for the [ban exception](#ban-exception-channel-mode) and [invite exception](#invite-exception-channel-mode) modes.

Ensure that extban masks are actually typically supported in ban exception and invite exception modes.

We should include a list of 'typical' extban characters and their associated meaning, but make sure we specify that these are not standardised and may change based on server software. See also the irc-defs [`EXTBAN` list](https://defs.ircdocs.horse/defs/extbans.html).

Examples:

      EXTBAN=~,cqnr

      EXTBAN=~,qjncrRa

      EXTBAN=,ABCNOQRSTUcjmprsz

### <a href="#hostlen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`HOSTLEN` Parameter

      Format: HOSTLEN=<number>
      Status: Proposed

The `HOSTLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length that a hostname may be on the server (whether cloaked, spoofed, or a looked-up domain name). Networks SHOULD be consistent with this value across different servers.

If a looked-up domain name is longer than this length, the server SHOULD opt to use the IP address instead, so that the hostname is underneath this length.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      HOSTLEN=63
      HOSTLEN=64

### <a href="#invex-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`INVEX` Parameter

      Format: INVEX=[character]
       Empty: I

The `INVEX` parameter indicates that the server supports invite exceptions, as specified in the [invite exception](#invite-exception-channel-mode) channel mode section.

The value is OPTIONAL and when not specified indicates that the letter `"I"` is used as the channel mode for invite exceptions. If the value is specified, the character indicates the letter which is used for invite exceptions.

Examples:

      INVEX

      INVEX=I

### <a href="#kicklen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`KICKLEN` Parameter

      Format: KICKLEN=<length>

The `KICKLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length for the `<reason>` of a [`KICK`](#kick-message) command. If a [`KICK`](#kick-message) `<reason>` has more characters than this parameter, it may be silently truncated by the server before being passed on to other clients. Clients MAY receive a [`KICK`](#kick-message) `<reason>` that has more characters than this parameter.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      KICKLEN=255

      KICKLEN=307

### <a href="#maxlist-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`MAXLIST` Parameter

      Format: MAXLIST=<modes>:<limit>{,<modes>:<limit>}

The `MAXLIST` parameter specifies how many “variable” modes of type A that have been defined in the [`CHANMODES`](#chanmodes-parameter) parameter that a client may set in total on a channel.

The value MUST be specified and is a list of `<modes>:<limit>` pairs, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. `<modes>` is a list of type A modes defined in [`CHANMODES`](#chanmodes-parameter). `<limit>` is a positive integer specifying the maximum number of entries that all of the modes in `<modes>`, combined, may set on a channel.

A client MUST NOT make any assumptions on how many mode entries may actually exist on any given channel. This limit only applies to the client setting new modes of the given types, and other clients may have different limits.

Examples:

      MAXLIST=beI:25           ; indicates that a client may set up to a total of 25 of a
                               combination of "b", "e", and "I" modes.

      MAXLIST=b:60,e:60,I:60   ; indicates that a client may set up to 60 "b" modes,
                               "e" modes, and 60 "I" modes.

      MAXLIST=beI:100,q:50     ; indicates that a client may set up to a total of 100 of
                               a combination of "b", "e", and "I" modes, and that they
                               may set up to 50 "q" modes.

### <a href="#maxtargets-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`MAXTARGETS` Parameter

      Format: MAXTARGETS=[number]

The `MAXTARGETS` parameter specifies the maximum number of targets a [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) or [`NOTICE`](#notice-message) command may have, and may apply to other commands based on server software.

The value is OPTIONAL and if specified, `[number]` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of targets those commands may have. If there is no limit, then `[number]` MAY not be specified.

The [`TARGMAX`](#targmax-parameter) parameter SHOULD be advertised instead of or in addition to this parameter. [`TARGMAX`](#targmax-parameter) is intended to replace `MAXTARGETS` as that parameter is more clear about which commands limits apply to.

Examples:

      MAXTARGETS=4

      MAXTARGETS=20

### <a href="#modes-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`MODES` Parameter

      Format: MODES=[number]

The `MODES` parameter specifies how many ‘variable’ modes may be set on a channel by a single [`MODE`](#mode-message) command from a client. A ‘variable’ mode is defined as being a type A, B or C mode as defined in the [`CHANMODES`](#chanmodes-parameter) parameter, or in the channel modes specified in the [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) parameter.

A client SHOULD NOT issue more ‘variable’ modes than this in a single [`MODE`](#mode-message) command. A server MAY however issue more ‘variable’ modes than this in a single [`MODE`](#mode-message) message. The value is OPTIONAL and when not specified indicates that there is no limit to the number of ‘variable’ modes that may be set in a single client [`MODE`](#mode-message) command. If the parameter is not published by the server at all, clients SHOULD assume `MODES=3`, corresponding to the RFC1459 behavior.

If the value is specified, it MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      MODES=4

      MODES=12

      MODES=20

### <a href="#network-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`NETWORK` Parameter

      Format: NETWORK=<string>

The `NETWORK` parameter indicates the name of the IRC network that the client is connected to. This parameter is advertised for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Clients SHOULD NOT use this value to make assumptions about supported features on the server as networks may change server software and configuration at any time.

Examples:

      NETWORK=EFNet

      NETWORK=Rizon

      NETWORK=Example\x20Network

### <a href="#nicklen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`NICKLEN` Parameter

       Format: NICKLEN=<number>

The `NICKLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length of a nickname that a client may set. Clients on the network MAY have longer nicks than this.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer. `30` or `31` are typical values for this parameter advertised by servers today.

Examples:

      NICKLEN=9

      NICKLEN=30

      NICKLEN=31

### <a href="#prefix-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`PREFIX` Parameter

       Format: PREFIX=[(modes)prefixes]
      Default: PREFIX=(ov)@+

Within channels, clients can have different statuses, denoted by single-character prefixes. The `PREFIX` parameter specifies these prefixes and the channel mode characters that they are mapped to. There is a one-to-one mapping between prefixes and channel modes. The prefixes in this parameter are in descending order, from the prefix that gives the most privileges to the prefix that gives the least.

The typical prefixes advertised in this parameter are listed in the [Channel Membership Prefixes](#channel-membership-prefixes) section.

The value is OPTIONAL and when it is not specified indicates that no prefixes are supported. If the parameter is not published by the server at all, clients SHOULD assume `PREFIX=(ov)@+`, corresponding to the RFC1459 behavior.

Examples:

      PREFIX=(ov)@+

      PREFIX=(ohv)@%+

      PREFIX=(qaohv)~&@%+

### <a href="#safelist-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`SAFELIST` Parameter

      Format: SAFELIST

If `SAFELIST` parameter is advertised, the server ensures that a client may perform the [`LIST`](#list-message) command without being disconnected due to the large volume of data the [`LIST`](#list-message) command generates.

The `SAFELIST` parameter MUST NOT be specified with a value.

Examples:

      SAFELIST

### <a href="#silence-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`SILENCE` Parameter

      Format: SILENCE[=<limit>]

The `SILENCE` parameter indicates the maximum number of entries a client can have in their silence list.

The value is OPTIONAL and if specified is a positive integer. If the value is not specified, the server does not support the [`SILENCE`](#silence-message) command.

Most IRC clients also include client-side filter/ignore lists as an alternative to this command.

Examples:

      SILENCE

      SILENCE=15

      SILENCE=32

### <a href="#statusmsg-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`STATUSMSG` Parameter

      Format: STATUSMSG=<string>

The `STATUSMSG` parameter indicates that the server supports a method for clients to send a message via the [`PRIVMSG`](#privmsg-message) / [`NOTICE`](#notice-message) commands to those people on a channel with (one of) the specified [channel membership prefixes](#channel-membership-prefixes).

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a list of prefixes as specified in the [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) parameter. Most servers today advertise every prefix in their [`PREFIX`](#prefix-parameter) parameter in `STATUSMSG`.

Examples:

      STATUSMSG=@+

      STATUSMSG=@%+

      STATUSMSG=~&@%+

### <a href="#targmax-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`TARGMAX` Parameter

      Format: TARGMAX=[<command>:[limit]{,<command>:[limit]}]

Certain client commands MAY contain multiple targets, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. The `TARGMAX` parameter defines the maximum number of targets allowed for commands which accept multiple targets. If this parameter is not advertised or a value is not sent then a client SHOULD assume that no commands except the `JOIN` and `PART` commands accept multiple parameters.

The value is OPTIONAL and is a set of `<command>:<limit>` pairs, delimited by a comma `(',', 0x2C)`. `<command>` is the name of a client command. `<limit>` is the maximum number of targets which that command accepts. If `<limit>` is specified, it is a positive integer. If `<limit>` is not specified, then there is no maximum number of targets for that command. Clients MUST treat `<command>` as case-insensitive.

Examples:

      TARGMAX=PRIVMSG:3,WHOIS:1,JOIN:

      TARGMAX=NAMES:1,LIST:1,KICK:1,WHOIS:1,PRIVMSG:4,NOTICE:4,ACCEPT:,MONITOR:

      TARGMAX=ACCEPT:,KICK:1,LIST:1,NAMES:1,NOTICE:4,PRIVMSG:4,WHOIS:1

### <a href="#topiclen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`TOPICLEN` Parameter

      Format: TOPICLEN=<number>

The `TOPICLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length of a topic that a client may set on a channel. Channels on the network MAY have topics with longer lengths than this.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer. `307` is the typical value for this parameter advertised by servers today.

Examples:

      TOPICLEN=307

      TOPICLEN=390

### <a href="#userlen-parameter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>`USERLEN` Parameter

      Format: USERLEN=<number>
      Status: Proposed

The `USERLEN` parameter indicates the maximum length that a username may be on the server. Networks SHOULD be consistent with this value across different servers. As noted in the [`USER`](#user-message) message, the tilde prefix (`"~"`), if it exists, contributes to the length of the username and would be included in this parameter.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

      USERLEN=12
      USERLEN=18

# <a href="#current-architectural-problems" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Architectural Problems

There are a number of recognized problems with the IRC protocol. This section only addresses the problems related to the architecture of the protocol.

## <a href="#scalability" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scalability

It is widely recognized that this protocol may not scale sufficiently well when used in a very large arena. The main problem comes from the requirement that all servers know about all other servers, clients, and channels, and that information regarding them be updated as soon as it changes.

Server-to-server protocols can attempt to alleviate this by, for example, only sending ‘necessary’ state information to leaf servers. These sort of optimisations are implementation-specific and are not covered in this document. However, server authors should take great care in their protocols to ensure race conditions and other network instability does not result from these attempts to improve the scalability of their protocol.

## <a href="#reliability" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reliability

As the only network configuration used for IRC servers is that of a spanning tree, each link between two servers is an obvious and serious point of failure.

Software authors are and have been experimenting with alternative topologies such as mesh networks. However, there is not yet a production implementation or specification of any topology other than spanning-tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <a href="#implementation-notes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Notes

The IRC protocol is reasonably complex. When writing software that interacts with it, there are certain choices that are implementation-defined, as well as certain areas that are commonly incorrectly implemented.

This section raises discussion, questions, and recommendations intended to help implementors. In particular, the advice/discussion here may be sloppy compared to the above, and the questions may be less well-defined or without strict answers, but regardless should help you when writing software that interacts with the IRC protocol.

## <a href="#character-encodings" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Character Encodings

Character encodings in IRC are hard. [UTF-8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629) is recommended, the mess of [Latin-1/ISO-8859-1(5)/CP1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) also seems common, but all sorts of other encodings are also used in practice. Particularly on networks that support other languages, and were created before UTF-8 became as widespread as it has.

When sending, we always recommend UTF-8. When decoding, we generally recommend trying UTF-8 and falling back to Latin-1 (what has been called the Hybrid encoding).

For clients, this is fine. Even if they incorrectly decode a private message, the user should see that the message has been decoded incorrectly and be able to resolve the issue (hopefully by telling the sending user to use UTF-8).

However, servers are in a trickier position (especially for PRIVMSG/NOTICE or any other command that takes arbitrary user input such as USER, TOPIC, etc). Servers should simply treat this input from the user as a character array they accept and then spit out again, no trouble.

Servers implemented in languages with first-class Unicode strings may wish to treat IRC lines and messages as Unicode text internally. For servers to treat messages in this way, they need to decode lines as they’re received and later encode the lines before they’re sent out.

This presents an issue. What if the line from the user is decoded incorrectly, modified (eg. by casefolding), and then sent out? (see also: [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake)). What these servers may instead do is either:

1.  follow the lead of the majority of existing servers and treat these parameters as byte arrays not to be parsed or decoded in any way.
2.  attempt to decode all incoming lines as UTF-8 (possibly using Hybrid encoding like clients do) and if the line cannot be decoded it is ignored or returns an error. The [IRCv3 `UTF8ONLY` specification](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/utf8-only) allows them to signal this to clients.

The former ensures all messages are sent correctly, and the latter simplifies server implementations and allows clients to disable decoding heuristics.

## <a href="#message-parsing-and-assembly" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Message Parsing and Assembly

Message parsing/assembly is one area where implementations can differ wildly, and is a common vector for both security issues and general runtime problems.

Message Parsing is turning raw IRC messages into the various message parts (tags, prefix, command, parameters). Message Assembly is the opposite – taking the various message parts and creating an IRC line to be sent over the wire.

Implementors should ensure that their message parsing and assembly responds in expected ways, by running their software through test cases. I recommend these public-domain [irc-parser-tests](https://github.com/DanielOaks/irc-parser-tests), which are reasonably extensive.

### <a href="#trailing" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trailing

Trailing is *a completely normal parameter*, except for the fact that it can contain spaces. When parsing messages, the ‘normal params’ and trailing should be appended and returned as a single list containing all the message params.

This is an example of an incorrect parser, that specifically separates normal params and trailing. When returning messages after parsing, **don’t return a struct/object containing these variables:**

      Message
          .Tags
          .Source
          .Verb
          .Params (containing all but the trailing param)
          .Trailing (containing just the trailing param)

Trailing *is a normal parameter*. Separating the parameter types in this way *will cause many breakages and weird issues*, as logic code will depend on the final param being in either `.Params` or `.Trailing`, when the simple fact is that it can be in either. Make sure that your message parser instead outputs parsed messages more like this:

      Message
          .Tags
          .Source
          .Verb
          .Params (including all normal params, and the trailing param if it exists)

This will make sure that you don’t run into silly trailing parameter errors.

### <a href="#direct-string-comparisons-on-irc-lines" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Direct String Comparisons on IRC Lines

Some software decides that the best way to process incoming lines is with something along the lines of this:

      Line = NewIRCLineFromSocket()
      If Line.StartsWith("PART") {
          Part(...etc...)
      } Else If Line.StartsWith("QUIT") {
          Quit(...etc...)
      }

This is bad. This will break. Here’s why: *Any IRC message can choose to include or not include the `source`*.

If you directly compare the beginning of lines like this, then you will break when servers decide to start including sources on messages (for example, some newer IRCds decide to include the source on all messages that they output). This results in clients that don’t correctly parse incoming messages and break as a result.

Instead, you should make sure that you send incoming lines through a message parser, and then do things based on what’s output by that parser. For instance:

      Message = IRCMessageParser(Line)
      If Message.Verb == "PART" {
            Part(...etc...)
      } Else If Message.Verb == "QUIT" {
            Quit(...etc...)
      }

This will ensure that your software doesn’t break when clients or servers send extra, or omit unnecessary, message elements.

Something to keep in mind is that the message verb is always case insensitive, so you should casemap it appropriately before doing comparisons similar to the above. In my own IRC libraries, I convert the verb to uppercase before returning the message.

## <a href="#casemapping" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Casemapping

Casemapping, at least right now, is a topic where implementations differ greatly.

### <a href="#servers" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Servers

-   Does your server use `"rfc1459"` or `"rfc1459-strict"` casemapping? If so, can you use a casemapping with less ambiguity such as `"ascii"`?
-   Does your server store state using nicks/channel names as keys? If so, is your server written in such a way that keys are casefolded automatically, or that ensures keys are casefolded before using them in this way?

### <a href="#clients" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clients

-   Does your client store state using nicks/channel names as keys, and if so do you casefold those keys appropriately?
-   Does your client discover the casemapping to use from the [`CASEMAPPING`](#casemapping-parameter) `RPL_ISUPPORT` parameter on connection? If so, does your client use the appropriate casemapping based on it?

## <a href="#obsolete-commands" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obsolete Commands

-   [`SUMMON`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812#section-4.5): was used to request people to connect to the network, by writing to their TTY. This only made sense back when users had shells on the same server as the IRC daemon.
-   [`TRACE`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812#section-3.4.8): showed a path in the server graph, between the user and a target. Nowadays, many servers either don’t implement it, or return redacted data.
-   [`ISON`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812#section-4.9): replaced by the [IRCv3 Monitor](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/monitor.html) specification
-   [`WATCH`](https://github.com/grawity/irc-docs/blob/master/client/draft-meglio-irc-watch-00.txt): was never formally specified, and is also replaced by [IRCv3 Monitor](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/monitor.html).

## <a href="#obsolete-numerics" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obsolete Numerics

These are numerics contained in [RFC1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) and [RFC2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812) that are not contained in this document or that should be considered obsolete.

-   **`RPL_BOUNCE (005)`**: `005` is now used for [`RPL_ISUPPORT`](#rplisupport-005) `(005)`. [`RPL_BOUNCE`](#rplbounce-010) `(010)` was moved to `010`
-   **`RPL_SUMMONING (342)`**: Was a reply to the deprecated `SUMMON` command.
